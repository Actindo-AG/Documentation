# Payment process   

The single steps of this process depend on the workflow settings with which a single step can be individually developed. The standard payment process is as follows:
1. The customer clicks on the "Pay now" button on the payment service provider's interface.
2. The payment service provider (PSD) sends an authorization transaction to Actindo and the shop creates an ID for this transaction. Actindo links both in an authorization transaction.
