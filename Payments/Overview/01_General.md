# General information
The automatic processing and booking of payments are important success and efficiency factors for companies. This is especially true if you receive orders from several sales channels and offer different payment methods via external service providers. By linking the *Payment Processing* and *Payments* modules, the *Actindo Core1 Platform* enables a holistic automated process flow from the receipt of payments to the final allocation of incoming payments.
