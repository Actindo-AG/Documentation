# General information
The automatic processing and posting of payments are important success and efficiency factors for companies. This is especially true if you receive orders from several sales channels and offer different payment methods via external service providers. The *Payments* module gives you the possibility to connect various payment service providers such as Adyen&trade; or Paypal&trade;. This way, you will be able to organize and track your payments directly from the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. Furthermore, the module allows fully automated processing of incoming payments and refunds.  The *Payments* module acts as a link between payment providers and an accounting solution.      


This documentation refers to the *Payments* module version 4.1.0. There may be differences in the user interface, features, and operation if your *Payments* module is installed in a different version.
