## Payments in the order process

The whole payments steps are part of the order workflow and, except the confirmation menu entry, you can only monitor the steps for errors occurred during processing the order workflow or for communication errors occurred during transferring the data between the payment service provider and Actindo. As these processes are invisible, the following scheme shows the single payments steps in the order workflow.
