## Automated import
With the *Payments* module of Actindo, pre-authorized payments are captured automatically at the moment orders are delivered. In case of returns or credit notes, refund requests are automatically sent out to the original means of payment. By using the 4-eyes principle, you can optionally double-check the refunds, for example, with specific user permissions depending on the invoice amount.  


## Connection to payment service providers
Using our simple EBICS integration, you can flexibly connect various payment service providers such as Adyen&trade;, Paypal&trade;, credit cards, or bank transactions to the *Actindo Core1 platform*. 


## Generation of payments for POS, telephone sales and sales representatives
Depending on the type of integration, you can also generate payments from POS terminals. Furthermore, you can process payments from telephone sales and field sales representatives just as easily. 


## Import of bank statements and automatic posting
Bank statements and reports from payment service providers can be automatically processed and posted to your accounting module. In case of prepayments, you can hold the shipment of orders until the invoice amount is received. It is then and automatically released for shipment after payment has been made.


## Payment processing and accounting linked 
 The Actindo *Payment* module connects the business accounts at your various payment service providers and the Actindo *Accounting* module. In being the smart connection between those two modules, the Actindo *Payment* module helps you to process orders faster and more efficiently. Thanks to automated payment checks, incoming payments are registered directly, and orders could therefore be processed immediately. Refunds can be made just as quickly and automatically. By linking payment and accounting, you not only minimize the workload for your employees, but also offer your customers a smooth and fast service. 


## Managing all payments centrally 
The payment options for customers are diverse, and so are the payment service providers that exist on the market today. In order to be able to offer your customers the widest possible range of payment methods - from invoice to credit card to direct debit - cooperation with various providers is required. Actindo's payment module enables the simple connection of various payment service providers, such as Klarna&trade;, Paypal&trade;, or banks via EBICS. This enables the management of all payments and refunds centrally via the *Actindo Core1 platform*.  

## Handling of sensitive data
Although you can view and monitor all incoming payments and refunds, you do not have access to any sensitive customer data. In the *Payments* module, all incoming payments and refunds are referenced to the number of the payment service provider transactions. Sensible data such as customer names, bank or credit card details are not visible in the *Payments* module.
