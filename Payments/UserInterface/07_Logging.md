# Logging


The Logging menu entry is used to check different logs.
It only contains the LIST tab.

>[Info] The Logging menu entry provides an overall view on all logs that has been created during the different phases of the payment processing. It is recommended to open the LIST sub-tabs of the Authorizations, Refunds etc. menu entries to have a more specific view on the logs. For example, see [Authorizations &ndash; Logs](01_ListAuthorizations.md#authorizations-â€“-logs).
