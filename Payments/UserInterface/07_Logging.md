# Logging


The Logging menu entry is used to check different logs.
It only contains the [LIST](07a_ListLogging.md) tab.

>[Info] The *Logging* menu entry provides an overall view on all logs that have been created during the different phases of the payment processing. It is recommended to open the *LIST* sub-tabs of the corresponding menu entries to have a more specific view on the logs such as [Authorizations &ndash; Logs](01a_ListAuthorizations.md#authorizations-â€“-logs).
