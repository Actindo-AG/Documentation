# General information

The *Taxes* module provides the *Invoicing* module with the appropriate tax rate to be applied to a particular order. Taking into account the details available in the order confirmation and the delivery note, the system decision matrix determines the tax zone to be applied, which is in turn needed to define the applicable tax rate. For detailed information, see [Manage the decision matrix](../Operation/01_ManageDecisionMatrix.md).


IU-relevant information

The *TAX RATES* tab displays a list of all available tax rates. The default configuration covers all standard cases for a company based in Germany delivering within the European Union. New tax rates can be added to adapt the system to the customer's needs, also dealing with special tax regimes within or outside the European Union.


The *TAX CLASSES* tab allows to create any number of tax classes to be assigned to a product or group of products. Once a tax class is created in this tab, it becomes available to be selected in the *Tax class* drop-down list when creating or editing a tax rate in the *TAX RATES* tab. For detailed information about creating or editing a tax rate, see [Manage the tax rates](./01_ManageTaxRates.md).
