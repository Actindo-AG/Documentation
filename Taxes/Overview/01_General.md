# General information

The *Taxes* module provides the *Invoicing* module with the appropriate tax rate to be applied to a particular order. Taking into account the details available in the order confirmation and the delivery note, the system decision matrix determines the tax zone to be applied, which is in turn needed to define the applicable tax rate. For detailed information, see [Manage the decision matrix](../Operation/01_ManageDecisionMatrix.md).

The *TAX RATES* tab displays a list of all available tax rates. The default configuration covers all standard cases for a company based in Germany delivering within the European Union. New tax rates can be added to adapt the system to the customer's needs, also dealing with special tax regimes within or outside the European Union.
