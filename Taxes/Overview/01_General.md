# General information

The *Taxes* module of the Actindo Core1 Platform allows you configure the system's automatic tax feature to match your specific business requirements. You can define the specific tax classes applicable to your products, determine the different tax zones where you operate, and set up an unlimited number of tax rates, which can also be specified according to their validity period.
