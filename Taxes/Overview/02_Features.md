# Key features

Customize your taxation system to the smallest detail:

- Crate multiple tax scenarios  
The *Taxes* module allows you to configure multiple tax scenarios depending on different variables in all the territories where you operate. Whether you are shipping your products from the country where your company is based or from a fulfilment center in another EU country, or you are delivering your products to the domestic market, to another member state or even to a third country outside the EU, all these variables can be defined simultaneously in the system.

- Configure special tax regimes  
With the *Taxes* module, it is possible to add tax exceptions affecting specific areas, up to postcode level, within a country, as well as product-specific tax rates in each territory.

- Determine automatically the applicable tax zone    
Thanks to the decision matrix, the applicable tax zone can be determined automatically, as well as the tax rate to be applied, thereby saving time, gaining accuracy, and eliminating error-prone manual operation.

- Automatic tax application in your invoices and order documentation  
Through the interaction with the *Invoicing* module, the applicable tax rate is automatically applied to your invoices, and the VAT ID number is included in your invoices and all relevant order documentation.
