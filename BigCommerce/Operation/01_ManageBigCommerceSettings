## Manage API settings


## Manage multiple shipping addresses

As *Omni-Channel* is not able to handle multiple shipping addresses, you must check a specific setting in *BigCommerce* to avoid conflicts.

# Procedure

*BigCommerce store > Settings*

![BigCommerce settings](../../Assets/Screenshots/BigCommerce/Operations/BigCommerceSettings.png "[BigCommerce settings]")

1. Scroll down to the *Advanced* area and select 
*Checkout > Shipping*.

2. Ensure that the *Allow customers to select multiple shipping addresses for an order* setting is not selected.
