## Manage multiple shipping addresses

As the driver is not able to handle multiple shipping addresses, you must check a specific setting in *BigCommerce* to avoid failures during the import. Any orders utilizing multiple shipping addresses cannot be imported and will fail during the import.

# Procedure

*BigCommerce store > Settings*

![BigCommerce settings](../../Assets/Screenshots/BigCommerce/Operations/BigCommerceSettings.png "[BigCommerce settings]")

1. Display the *Advanced* area and display
*Checkout > Shipping*. 

   ![Check multiple shipment addresses](../../Assets/Screenshots/BigCommerce/Operations/CheckMultipleAddress.png "[Check multiple shipment addresses]")

2. Ensure that the *Allow customers to select multiple shipping addresses for an order* setting is not selected.
