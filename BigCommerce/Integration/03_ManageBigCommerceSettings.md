## Manage multiple shipping addresses

Although *BigCommerce* allows multiple shipping addresses, *Actindo* supports the import of one shipping address only.   Any orders that use multiple shipping addresses cannot be imported and will fail during the import.  
To avoid failures during the import, you must check a specific setting in *BigCommerce*. 

# Procedure

*BigCommerce store > Settings*

![BigCommerce settings](../../Assets/Screenshots/Channels/Settings/Connections/BigCommerce/BigCommerceSettings.png "[BigCommerce settings]")

1. Display the *Advanced* area and display
*Checkout > Shipping*. 

   ![Check multiple shipment addresses](../../Assets/Screenshots/Channels/Settings/Connections/BigCommerce/CheckMultipleAddress.png "[Check multiple shipment addresses]")

2. Ensure that the *Allow customers to select multiple shipping addresses for an order* setting is not selected.
