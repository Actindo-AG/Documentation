BigCommerce is one of our partners in the MACH-Alliance. With its API-First approach to E-Commerce, BigCommerce aims to simplify E-Commerce on an enterprise level. Through the integration of BigCommerce as a Channels Extension, Customers will be able to connect their BigCommerce shop and thus manage all areas of work processes of online retailing centrally and from one place.

The BigCommerce Driver is able to manage products, orders and shipments. Products can be imported from PIM or created directly in Channels. On top of the existing product attributes provided by BigCommerce, customers can add custom attributes to products to further improve their product representation. Additionally, thanks to BigCommerceâ€™s extensive API, the driver can import already existing offers which simplifies the onboarding process for a new connection. Also, very helpful for successful onboarding is the Actindo Onboarding App in the BigCommerce App-Store. Using this app, a new Channels Connection can be automatically created and authorized. This way the customer can quickly start managing products, orders and shipments using the BigCommerce integration.
