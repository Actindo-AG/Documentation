# Features

The *BigCommerce* driver for *Actindo* can manage the following:
- Products
- Offers
- Orders
- Shipments   

This way you can quickly start managing products, orders, and shipments using the *BigCommerce* integration.

 
## How it works

- **Onboarding app**      
    
   A useful tool for a successful onboarding is the *Actindo Core1 DOP connector* app, available in the *BigCommerce* app store. This app enables you to create and authorize new *Omni-Channel* connections automatically for every store you have in *BigCommerce*.
   
- **Products**    
  Via the *Ommni-Channel* module, you can download the products needed for your *BigCommerce* store including all merchant-specific additional fields from the *PIM* module or download *Omni-Channel* offers directly. If you have already created products in *BigCommerce*, you can import them to *Omni-Channel*. 
  On top of the existing product attributes provided by *BigCommerce*, you can add custom attributes to products to enhance your product representation.

- **Offers**   
   Thanks to *BigCommerceâ€™s* extensive API, the driver can import already existing offers and variant sets to *Actindo*. This simplifies the onboarding process for a new connection.

- **Orders**     
  The orders in *BigCommerce* are imported to *Actindo*. You can configure the order import settings in the *BigCommerce* connection in *Actindo*.

- **Shipments**  
  Shipments created in *Actindo* are automatically exported to the related *BigCommerce* store.
