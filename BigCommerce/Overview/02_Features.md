# Key features

The *BigCommerce* driver for *Actindo* can manage products, offers, orders, and shipments of multiple *BigCommerce* stores. You can export your products from the *PIM* module or manage the offers directly in the *Omni-Channels* module. 

 
## How it works

- **Onboarding app**      
    
   A useful tool for a successful onboarding is the *Actindo Core1 DOP connector* app. It is available in the *BigCommerce* app store. The app enables you to create and authorize a new *Omni-Channel* connection automatically.
   
- **Products**    
  Via the *Ommni-Channel* module, you can download the products needed for your *BigCommerce* store. This includes all merchant-specific additional fields from the *PIM* module, or you download *Omni-Channel* offers directly. If you have already created products in *BigCommerce*, you can import them to *Omni-Channel*. 
  On top of the existing product attributes provided by *BigCommerce*, you can add custom attributes to products to enhance your product representation.

- **Offers**   
   Thanks to *BigCommerceâ€™s* extensive API, the driver can import already existing offers and variant sets to *Actindo*. This simplifies the onboarding process for a new connection.

- **Orders**     
  The orders in *BigCommerce* are imported to *Actindo*. You can configure the order import settings in the *BigCommerce* connection in the *Omni-Channel* module.

- **Shipments**  
  Shipments created in *Actindo* are automatically exported to the related *BigCommerce* store.
