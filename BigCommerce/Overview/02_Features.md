# Features

- The *BigCommerce* driver is able to manage the following:
   - Products
   - Offers
   - Orders
   - Shipments   

  This way you can quickly start managing products, orders, and shipments using the *BigCommerce* integration.

 
## How it works

- **Onboarding app**      
   Very helpful for successful onboarding is the *Actindo Core1 DOP connector* app in the *BigCommerce* app store. By using this app, you can automatically create and authorize a new *OmniChannel* connections for each of the stores you run in *BigCommerce*.  
   
- **Products**    
  Download of *BigCommerce* products including all merchant-specific additional fields from the *PIM* module or downloading the *Omni-Channel* offers.   
  If you have the PIM module not in use, product and offer data can be hold in *BigCommerce* and be imported to the *Omni-Channel* module.  
  On top of the existing product attributes provided by *BigCommerce*, you can add custom attributes to products to further improve your product representation.

- **Offers**   
   Thanks to *BigCommerceâ€™s* extensive API, the driver can import already existing offers and variant sets to *Actindo*. This simplifies the onboarding process for a new connection.

- **Orders**     
  The orders in *BigCommerce* are imported to *Actindo*. You can configure the order import settings in the *BigCommerce* connection in *Actindo*.

- **Shipments**
