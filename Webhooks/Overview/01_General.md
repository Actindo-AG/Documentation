# General information

Webhooks are an easy way to send data to recipients. With Actindo's *Webhooks* module, you can not only define explicitly the data to be transferred, but also the events that trigger the sending of webhooks messages, as well as the way in which the data is sent.

Webhooks are very useful when you want to send messages with changes to single entities such as updated or created offers. You have a direct link to your shop system and are informed down to the minute about order or stock level changes.

Webhooks are a flexible alternative to APIs. You can use the data sent as you want. In contrast to API-controlled transfers, no configuration from Actindo is necessary, and you save the time and money required for the creation of customer-specific APIs.
You no longer need to create exports to get data out of the Actindo system and can individually decide what you want to do with the data. For example, you can connect to any third-party providers.



## Benefits
