## Description of the offer from product with completeness workflow

Once you have set up a basic workflow, you can edit it to add the necessary steps. 

#### Prerequisites

You have have set up an offer from product basic workflow, see [How to set up an offer from product basic workflow](./01_Introduction.md#how-to-set-up-an-offer-from-product-basic-workflow).

#### Procedure

1. Select the newly created workflow to edit it.  
    The workflow editor is displayed.

2. Create a *PIM Product saved* trigger to create an offer when a product is updated.  
    A new trigger input line is displayed.

    For detailed information on how to create a trigger, see [Create a trigger](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/03_ManageTriggers.md#create-a-trigger).

3. Configure the following settings for the *PIM Product saved* trigger:

    | Triggers ||
    |----|----|
    |**Name** | PIM product saved |
    |**Model** | Actindo\Modules\Actindo\PIM\Models\PIMProduct |
    |**Event** | After saving | 
    |**Condition fulfillment** | If all are met |   
    |**Status** | Active |
    |**Process priority** | 10 | 
    | **Unique check** | No |

[comment]: <> (Configure the workflow; trigger/s auch gleich fÃ¼r alle, auf Basic und darauf verweisen!)

4. Click the [NEW ACTION] button.  
    A window with a list of actions is displayed. 

    For detailed information on how to add a transition, see [Add a transition](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#add-a-transition).

5. Select the *Split by criterion* action.  
    The selected action is displayed in the workflow editor.

6. Configure the *Split by criterion* action with the following settings:  

    | Configuration ||
    |----|----|
    | **Path** | _pim_completeness.totalCompleteness |
    | **Operator** | >= |
    | **Value** | 100 |

    It is recommended to change the name in the *Label* field to a descriptive name, for example, **Completeness 100?** in this case.

7. Connect the input port to the start place. For detailed information, see [Connect the transition](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#connect-the-transition).

    After setting it up, the *Split by criterion* action has the following structure: 
    
    | Input ports     | Value | -  | Output ports | Value    |
    | --------------- | --- | ---| -------------- | ----  |
    | *in*  | PIMProduct| - | *match* | PIMProduct |
    | -     |          | - | *noMatch* | (to end place)   |
    
8. Click the [NEW ACTION] button.  
    A window with a list of actions is displayed.
    
9. Select the *Create offer* action.
    The selected action is displayed in the workflow editor.

10. Connect the first input port to the *match* output port from the *Completeness 100?* action. For detailed information, see [Connect the transition](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#connect-the-transition).

11. Configure the *Create offer* action static inputs as follows:

    | Static inputs | |
    |---------------|-|
    | **connection** | { "id": 2 } (static input) |
    | **changeTracking** | - |
    | **initialStatus** | "inactive" |
    | **destinationAttributeSet** | - |
    | **unique** | "1" |

12. Click on [DEPLOY] to publish the workflow.  
    The workflow is published and will be used from now on.
