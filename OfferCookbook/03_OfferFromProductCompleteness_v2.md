## How to set up an offer from product workflow

To set up any workflow, you have to create a new workflow and define the basic settings first. For detailed information, see [Define workflow basic settings](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#define-the-workflow-basic-settings). 

For detailed information on how to create a workflow, see [Create a workflow](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#create-a-workflow).

#### Prerequisites

- You have created a *PIM* product, see [Create a product](../PIM/Operation/01_ManageProducts.md#create-a-product).
- You have created a connection to a sales channel, see [Create a connection](../Channels/Integration/01_ManageConnections.md#create-a-connection).

#### Procedure

*Process Orchestration > Workflows > Tab OVERVIEW*

Create a new workflow and define the following workflow basic settings: 

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |

## Description of the offer from product with completeness workflow

Once you have set up a basic workflow, you can edit it to add the necessary steps. For detailed information on setting up the basic workflow, see [Set up the basic workflow](#set-up-the-basic-workflow).

Click on the workflow you want to edit, see [Edit a workflow](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/01_ManageWorkflows.md#edit-a-workflow).

### Product saved trigger

![PIM product saved trigger](../Assets/Screenshots/OfferCookbook/PIMProductSavedTrigger.png "[PIM product saved trigger]")

1. Create a *PIM Product saved* trigger to create an offer when a product is updated.  
    A new trigger input line is displayed.

    For detailed information on how to create a trigger, see [Create a trigger](../ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/03_ManageTriggers.md#create-a-trigger).

2. Configure the following settings for the *PIM Product saved* trigger:

    | Triggers ||
    |----|----|
    |**Name** | PIM product saved |
    |**Model** | Actindo\Modules\Actindo\PIM\Models\PIMProduct |
    |**Event** | After saving | 
    |**Condition fulfillment** | If all are met |   
    |**Status** | Active |
    |**Process priority** | 10 | 
    | **Unique check** | No |

### Split by criterion

![Split by criterion](../Assets/Screenshots/OfferCookbook/Completeness100Action.png "[Split by criterion]")

Select the *Split by criterion* action and configure it with the following settings:

| Configuration ||
|----|----|
| **Path** | _pim_completeness.totalCompleteness |
| **Operator** | >= |
| **Value** | 100 |

It is recommended to change the name in the *Label* field to a descriptive name, for example, **Completeness 100** in this case.

### Create offer

![Create offer](../Assets/Screenshots/OfferCookbook/CreateOfferAction.png "[Create offer]")

Select the *Create offer* action and configure it with the following settings:

| Static inputs | |
|---------------|-|
| **connection** | { "id": 2 } (static input) |
| **changeTracking** | - |
| **initialStatus** | "inactive" |
| **destinationAttributeSet** | - |
| **unique** | "1" |
