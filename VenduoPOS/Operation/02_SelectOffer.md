## Use single scan

If the same offer is selected more than once, it is displayed in the bill list as one product with the corresponding quantity indication. By using the single scan feature, each offer is listed as a single product in the bill list, even if it is the same offer. This allows you to treat each product in the booking individually, e. g. to apply an individual discount.
