# Manage the orders and returns

When an order is placed on the marketplace, this order must be imported into *Omni-Channel* to further process it in the *Order Management* module.   
You can configure an automatic import of orders for a certain time interval, see [Configure the order import](../Integration/04_ConfigureOrdersReturns.md#configure-the-order-import). You can also manually trigger the import of orders at any time.

For certain marketplaces, it is possible to announce a return. In this case, these returns can be imported to *Omni-Channel* to further process them in the *Return management* module.   
You can configure an automatic import of returns for a certain time interval, see [Configure the return import](../Integration/04_ConfigureOrdersReturns.md#configure-the-return-import). You can also manually trigger the import of returns at any time.


## Import orders manually

If you want to import the orders from a marketplace outside the specified time interval, you can manually trigger the import either for a certain connection or for all configured connections at once.
