# Manage the Shopware 6 connection

To establish a connection to a Shopware 6 shop, there are several particularities to consider. Therefore, the creation and the configuration of the Shopware 6 connection are described in detail below.


## Create a Shopware 6 connection

Create the connection to a Shopware 6 shop using the Shopware 6 driver. Further settings can only be configured after the connection has been established.

Be aware that, before a Shopware 6 connection can be established in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, the corresponding integration must be created in Shopware 6. Besides, all languages configured in Shopware 6 must be available in the *DataHub* module. Otherwise, an error is displayed when trying to create the connection in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. The connection creation is then cancelled.

#### Prerequisites

- A Shopware 6 account has been created.
- The *Shopware 6* plugin has been installed.  
- All languages configured in the Shopware 6 account have also been created in the *DataHub* module, see [Create a language](../../DataHub/Integration/05_ManageLanguages.md#create-a-language). 

> [Info] For the *Omni-Channel* module version 4.1.0 or higher, the *Shopware 6* plugin is required in at least version 4.0.0.
