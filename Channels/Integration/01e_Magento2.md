    > [Info] The global default language in Magento 2 is defined at root level and is used to import and globally maintain data that are untranslatable, for example a product name, and therefore not store view specific.

    ![Settings image name regular expression](../../Assets/Screenshots/Channels/Settings/Connections/Magento2/EditConnectionSettings_ImageNameRegEx.png "[Settings image name regular expression]")

[comment]: <> (Oli: Random Name oder wird der ECM Name herangezogen?)

16. If desired, disable the *Use ECM image name* toggle. By default, the toggle is enabled.  
    If disabled, the image names are generated randomly by upload. If enabled, the image names configured in the *ECM* module are uploaded.
  
    > [Info] The image names can be defined by the user when uploading image files in the *ECM* module. When defining image file names in the *ECM* module, note that file names that are longer than 89 characters cannot be uploaded to the Magento 2 shop.

17. If desired, define a regular expression to shorten and customize the image names configured in the *ECM* module.  
    Any sequence of characters entered that matches a regular expression will be removed from the image name when the image files are uploaded to the Magento 2 shop.  
    For detailed information about regular expressions, see https://regex101.com/.
