# Offer import

*Omni-Channel > Offer import*

The *Offer import* menu entry is used to manage the offer imports.

The *Offer import* user interface is composed of the following tabs:
- [OFFER IMPORT](./04a_OfferImport.md)
- [PIM->CHANNELS](./04b_PIMChannels.md)
- [CHANNELS->PIM](./04c_ChannelsPIM.md) 

The *PIM->CHANNELS* and the *CHANNELS->PIM* tab are only displayed, if the *PIM* module and the *PIM-Channels Connection* plugin are installed.
