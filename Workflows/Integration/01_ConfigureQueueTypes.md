# Configure the queue types

Configure an arbitrary number of individual queue types to be able to process certain actions faster. You can configure an unlimited number of queue types with a defined number of workers and the and a defined sequence of how actions are to be processed. The total number of workers that can be assigned to the queue types is limited by the number of booked vCores.
The *Default* queue type is predefined and is assigned by default to all actions. It can manually be overrridden by individual queue types.
