# Manage the package types

Package types serve as a suggestion for the fulfiller on the type of packaging and the preferred carrier that may apply for a shipment. Package types can be defined using many different criteria. All relevant fields (attributes) used are mapped via ETL from the relevant business document.  

The package types suggested may not be applicable for all users, for instance, in the case of non-physical shipments or if the fulfiller has defined his own package types.
