# Key features

Easily optimize shipping processes with the Actindo *Fulfillment* module:

- Connection to shipping service providers  
Shipping can be handled and optimized easily with the help of our integrations to popular shipping providers, such as DHL, DPD, FedEx, Dilos, Shipwire or Prologis. Those carriers can be connected independently via DataHub and API.   

- Integrated shipping module  
Within the shipping module you can easily create labels, package slips, return slips and other delivery documents for your orders.

- Connection to logistics providers  
Logistics and fulfillment providers for your shipping processes can be connected natively to the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. This way, all information about your shipments would be available to you in one place.

- Support for shadow and consignment warehouses  
Fulfillment providers and consignment warehouses can be mapped as shadow warehouses in the *Actindo Core 1 Platform* so that all warehouse movements are available live in your system.

## Simplified sales management

**Support individual shipping processes**   
Customers are placing increasing value on flexibility when purchasing - this applies to the variety of shipping options too. Those who provide a variety of choices to their customers must carefully design internal shipping processes and adapt them to their own requirements.  

The Actindo *Fulfillment* module offers the possibility to easily connect different shipping service providers and external providers. If a direct integration via an API is not possible, data can be prepared via the central *DataHub* module and be then provided in the required format for integration. This allows you to easily offer your customers flexible delivery options and different shipping service providers while efficiently managing internal processes.
