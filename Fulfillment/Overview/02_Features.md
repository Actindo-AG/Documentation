# Key features

Easily optimize shipping processes with the Actindo *Fulfillment* module:

- Connection to logistics providers  
    Logistics and fulfillment providers for your shipping processes can be connected natively to the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. This way, all information about your shipments would be available to you in one place.

- Support for warehouse management   
    Depending on the driver, it is possible to map the fulfiller's warehouses in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, so that all stock movements are available live in your system.

- Up-to-date tracking information  
    All shipment tracking data provided by the fulfiller via driver, such as tracking link and number, or delivery and return status, is available and updated in real time in your system.

## Simplified sales management

**Support individual shipping processes**   
Customers are placing increasing value on flexibility when purchasing &ndash; this applies to the variety of shipping options too. Those who provide a variety of choices to their customers must carefully design internal shipping processes and adapt them to their own requirements.  

The Actindo *Fulfillment* module offers the possibility to easily connect different logistics providers and other external web services. If a direct integration via an API is not possible, data can be prepared via the central *DataHub* module and be then provided in the required format for integration. This allows you to easily offer your customers flexible delivery options and different shipping service providers while efficiently managing internal processes.
