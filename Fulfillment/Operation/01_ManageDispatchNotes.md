# Manage the dispatch notes

Dispatch notes are shipment requests generated by the system when a delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module. The dispatch note is than sent to the order fulfiller, who will in turn arrange the shipment.

The communication between the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the fulfiller's internal system takes place via a connection driver. The *Actindo Core1 Platform* sends the fulfiller the information they need based on the information provided in the delivery note, which has been previously mapped via the ETL function in the *DataHub* module. The fulfiller, on the other hand, sends back a confirmation message to update the shipment status accordingly during all stages of the fulfillment process.   

The *Fulfillment* module works together with the *Workflows* module. Once the *Fulfillment* module has been configured, a workflow must be created for the corresponding business process, which runs automatically in the *Workflows* module. The *Fulfillment* module is therefore designed to monitor the fulfillment process but not to steer it. For this purpose, the *Workflows* module should be used.

## Check a dispatch note

The dispatch note provides numerous data about the order, which may vary depending on the connection settings. 

Following order-related data can be checked:

- Dispatch note status
- Document number, which equals the delivery note number in the *Order management* module
- Shipment status, see [Check shipment](02_CheckShipment.md)  
- Shipping type
- Carrier
- Receiver details (name and zip code)

### Check dispatch note status

The dispatch note status can be checked in the list of dispatch notes. The dispatch note status displays the current stage in the fulfillment process.

#### Prerequisites

- A connection has been created, see [Create a connection](01_ManageConnections.md#create-a-connection).
- A delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module and, therefore, a dispatch note has been generated.

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Check the status displayed in the *Status* column. The following options can be displayed:  
  - **New dispatch note**  
    The dispatch note has been newly created.
  - **Transferred to partner**  
    The dispatch note has been transferred to partner but no receival has been confirmed yet. In rare occasions, the fulfiller may note receive a dispatch note. In that case, it may be necessary to resend the dispatch note, see [Export a dispatch note](#export-a-dispatch-note).
  - **Partner confirmed receival**  
    The fulfiller has confirmed receival of the dispatch note. The shipment status will be updated shortly, see [Check shipment status](02_CheckShipment.md#check-the-shipment-status). Occasionally, the receival may not be confirmed by the fulfiller. In this case, it is possible to click on the [FORCE COMPLETION] button to confirm the dispatch note as complete to prevent subsequent processes from remaining waiting for confirmation, see [Complete a dispatch note](#complete-a-dispatch-note).
  - **Dispatch note completed**  
    The dispatch note has been processed.
  - **Error**  
    The dispatch note has given an error. 
    
    [comment]: <> (Dispatch note status: Error - Shipment status: Error -> Fulfiller hat Fehler gemeldet; Dispatch status Error - Shipment status New shipment, Error - No shipment, Error - Error, Error - Delivered -> Ist das überhaupt möglich? Keine Korrelation Dispatch note status - Shipment status???)
  - **Void**  
    The dispatch note is not valid.



2. Check the document number

3. Check the shipment status, see [Check shipment status](./02_CheckShipment.md#check-the-shipment-status).

4. Receiver details (name and zip code) - necessary/useful?





## Complete a dispatch note

Occasionally, the message sent by the fulfiller to confirm delivery may fail or may not be received. In this case, the dispatch note status will stay as **Partner confirmed receival**. To prevent subsequent processes from staying stuck/waiting for the complete status, the dispatch note status can be updated manually if necessary.




[comment]: <> (Unsicher von Ausgangssituation. Macht das so Sinn? Vielleicht Fehler festgestellt in Workflows? Wie weiß ich sonst, welche Dispatch note status nicht aktualisiert worden ist? Ich muss erst in Shipments prüfen...)

#### Prerequisites

- The shipment has been delivered.
- The dispatch note status is **Partner confirmed receival**.

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Click the dispatch note whose status has not been updated.
  The *Dispatch note ID* view is displayed.

2. Click the *Shipments* tab.  
  All shipments included in the dispatch note are displayed.

3. Check the shipment status (?)
  - If delivered, ...
  - If other than delivered, ...

[comment]: <> (Ist es überhaupt möglich/nötig? Wäre der Shipment status in der Dispatch notes nicht aktualisiert? Wie kann das passieren? Kommt ein Fehler von Workflows o.ä.?)

4. Click the checkbox of the dispatch note to be completed.
  The editing toolbar is displayed.

5. Click the [FORCE COMPLETION] button.  
  The message ... is displayed.
