# Manage the dispatch notes

Dispatch notes are shipment requests generated by the system when a delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module. The dispatch note is than sent to the order fulfiller, who will in turn arrange the shipment.

The communication between the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the fulfiller's internal system takes place via a connection driver. The *Actindo Core1 Platform* sends the fulfiller the information they need based on the information provided in the delivery note, which has been previously mapped via the ETL function in the *DataHub* module. The fulfiller, on the other hand, sends back a confirmation message to update the shipment status accordingly during all stages of the fulfillment process.   

The *Fulfillment* module works together with the *Workflows* module. Once the *Fulfillment* module has been configured, a workflow must be created for the corresponding business process, which runs automatically in the *Workflows* module. The *Fulfillment* module is therefore designed to monitor the fulfillment process but not to steer it. For this purpose, the *Workflows* module should be used.

## Check a dispatch note

The dispatch note provides numerous data about the order, which may vary depending on the connection settings. The following procedures to check specific data are described in detail below:

  - Dispatch note status, see [Check dispatch note status](#check-dispatch-note-status)
  - Shipment status, see [Check shipment status](#check-shipment-status)
  - Check shipment details, see [Check shipment details](#check-shipment-details)

Besides, the following general data can be checked in the list of dispatch notes:
- Document number, which equals the delivery note number in the *Order management* module
- Shipping type
- Carrier
- Receiver details (name and zip code)
- Error (Dispatch note status - Shipment status: Error -> Fulfiller hat Fehler gemeldet)

### Check the shipment details

Once the shipment has been arranged by the fulfiller, the shipment status is updated. The information provided by the fulfiller, such as tracking number or tracking link, can be checked.  

#### Prerequisites

- The dispatch note status is *Partner confirmed receival* or *Dispatch note completed*.

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Click the dispatch note related to the shipment you want to check. Alternatively, you can click the checkbox of the dispatch note to be checked and click the [VIEW] button in the editing toolbar.  
  The *Dispatch note ID* view is displayed. The *ATTRIBUTES* tab is by default preselected.

## Complete a dispatch note

Occasionally, the message sent by the fulfiller to confirm delivery may fail or may not be received. In this case, the dispatch note status will stay as **Partner confirmed receival**. To prevent subsequent processes from staying stuck/waiting for the complete status, the dispatch note status can be updated manually if necessary.
