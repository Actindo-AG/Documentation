# Manage the dispatch notes

Dispatch notes are shipment requests created by the system when a delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module. The dispatch note is than sent to the order fulfillment service provider, who in turn will performed the shipment.

The communication between the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the fulfillment provider system takes place via a connection driver.
