# Manage the dispatch notes

Dispatch notes are shipment requests generated by the system when a delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module. The dispatch note is than sent to the order fulfiller, who will in turn arrange the shipment.

The communication between the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the fulfiller's internal system takes place via a connection driver. The *Actindo Core1 Platform* sends the fulfiller the information they need based on the information provided in the delivery note, which has been previously mapped via the ETL function in the *DataHub* module. The fulfiller, on the other hand, sends back a confirmation message to update the shipment status accordingly during all stages of the fulfillment process.   


## Check a dispatch note

The dispatch note provides numerous data about the order, which may vary depending on the connection settings. Some of the details that can be checked are explained in detail below:

  - Dispatch note status, see [Check dispatch note status](#check-dispatch-note-status)
  - Shipment status, see [Check shipment status](#check-shipment-status)
  - Shipment details, see [Check shipment details](#check-shipment-details)

Besides, the following general details can be checked in the Dispatch notes list:
- Document number, which equals the delivery note number in the *Order management* module
- Shipping type
- Carrier
- Receiver details (name and zip code)

#### Prerequisites

- A connection has been created, see [Create a connection](01_ManageConnections.md#create-a-connection).
- A delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module and, therefore, a dispatch note has been generated.

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

## Complete a dispatch note

Occasionally, the message sent by the fulfiller to confirm delivery may fail or may not be received. In this case, the dispatch note status will stay as **Partner confirmed receival**. To prevent subsequent processes from staying stuck/waiting for the complete status, the dispatch note status can be updated manually if necessary.
