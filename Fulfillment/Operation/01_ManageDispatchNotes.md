# Manage the dispatch notes

Dispatch notes are shipment requests generated by the system when a delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module. The dispatch note is than sent to the order fulfiller, who will in turn arrange the shipment.

The communication between the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the fulfiller's internal system takes place via a connection driver. The *Actindo Core1 Platform* sends the fulfiller the information they need based on the information provided in the delivery note, which has been previously mapped via the ETL function in the *DataHub* module. The fulfiller, on the other hand, sends back a confirmation message to update the shipment status accordingly during all stages of the fulfillment process.   

The *Fulfillment* module works together with the *Workflows* module. Once the *Fulfillment* module has been configured, a workflow must be created for the corresponding business process, which runs automatically in the *Workflows* module. The *Fulfillment* module is therefore designed to monitor the fulfillment process but not to steer it. For this purpose, the *Workflows* module should be used.

## Check a dispatch note

A dispatch note provides numerous order-related details, which may vary depending on the connection settings. The following order-related details, among others, can be checked in the list of dispatch notes.

#### Prerequisites

- A connection has been created, see [Create a connection](01_ManageConnections.md#create-a-connection).
- A delivery note has been issued in the *Order management* module and, therefore, a dispatch note has been generated.

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Check the dispatch note status in the *Status* column. The status displays the current stage in the fulfillment process. The following options are available:  
    - **New dispatch note**  
        The dispatch note has been newly created.
    - **Transferred to partner**  
        The dispatch note has been transferred to partner but no receival has been confirmed yet. In rare occasions, the fulfiller may note receive a dispatch note. In that case, it may be necessary to resend the dispatch note, see [Export a dispatch note](#export-a-dispatch-note).
    - **Partner confirmed receival**  
        The fulfiller has confirmed receival of the dispatch note. The shipment status will be updated shortly, see [Check the shipment status](02_CheckShipment.md#check-the-shipment-status). Occasionally, the receival may not be confirmed by the fulfiller. In this case, it is possible to click the [FORCE COMPLETION] button to confirm the dispatch note as completed to prevent subsequent processes from remaining stuck waiting for confirmation, see [Complete a dispatch note](#complete-a-dispatch-note).
    - **Dispatch note completed**  
        The dispatch note has been processed.
    - **Error**  
        The dispatch note has given an error. 
    - **Void**  
        The dispatch note is not valid.

    If further information on the dispatch note status is needed, the list of messages generated in the communication process between the Core1 and the fulfiller can be checked in the *Logging* menu entry, see [Logging](../UserInterface/02a_Connections.md).

2. Check the dispatch note number in the *Document number* column.
    The document number equals the delivery note number and can be useful to find further order-related details in the *Order management* module.

3. Check the order number in the *Description* column. The order number is a customer-defined field. It can be useful to find further order-related details in the *Order management* module.

4. Check the package type identification number in the *Package type* column. Alternatively, click a dispatch note and select the *Attributes* sub-tab, if it is not preselected.  
    The package type identification number is displayed in the *FULFILLMENT DISPATCH NOTE BASE ATTRIBUTES* section.  

    > [Info] The package types are defined in the *PACKAGE TYPES* tab of *Settings* menu entry and provide detailed information on the package used for shipment, the shipping type, and the ship-to country, among others. For detailed information, see [Package types](../UserInterface/03b_PackageTypes.md).  

6. Check the shipment status in the *Shipment status* column. For further information, see [Check the shipment status](./02_CheckShipment.md#check-the-shipment-status).

7. Additional information can be displayed depending on the fields (attributes) mapped via driver. Click the ![Columns](../../Assets/Icons/Columns.png "[Columns]") Columns (x) button to display all available dispatch note attributes. 


## Complete a dispatch note

Occasionally, fulfillers do not notify, or the notification fails, when the order has been delivered. In this case, the dispatch note status is not automatically updated to completed. To prevent subsequent processes from remaining stuck waiting for the completed status, the dispatch note status can be updated manually if necessary.

[comment]: <> (Unsicher von Ausgangssituation. Macht das so Sinn? Vielleicht Fehler festgestellt in Workflows? Wie weiß ich sonst, welcher Dispatch note status nicht aktualisiert worden ist? Ich muss erst in Shipments prüfen...)

#### Prerequisites

- The shipment has been delivered.
- The dispatch note status is **Partner confirmed receival**.
- The shipment status stays as ![Circular arrows](../../Assets/Icons/CircularArrows.png "[Circular arrows]") (In progress).

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Click the dispatch note whose status has not been updated.
  The *Dispatch note ID* view is displayed.

2. Click the *Shipments* tab.  
  All shipments included in the dispatch note are displayed.

3. Check the shipment status: (?)
  - If delivered, ...
  - If other than delivered, ...

[comment]: <> (Ist es überhaupt möglich/nötig? Wäre der Shipment status in der Dispatch notes aktualisiert oder nicht? Wie kann das passieren? Kommt ein Fehler von Workflows o.ä.?)

4. Click the checkbox of the dispatch note(s) to be completed.
  The editing toolbar is displayed.

    > [Info] It is possible to update the status of several dispatch notes at once.

5. Click the [FORCE COMPLETION] button in the editing toolbar.  
  The message ... is displayed.

## Export a dispatch note

You can resend a dispatch note to the fulfiller if it has not been received for some reason.

#### Prerequisites

- A dispatch note has been generated.
- The dispatch note status is **Transferred to partner**.
- The shipment status is ![Cross](../../Assets/Icons/Cross02.png "[Cross]") (Cross), that is, no shipment has been arranged yet.

[comment]: <> (Stimmt das so? Oder Error - richtiger Weg zur Lösung wäre aber über Workflows, denn der Prozess schlägt auch fehl... S. Wissenstransfers Part 1, Min. 48. Dann wozu hier EXPORT button? Sollen wir den Prozess beschreiben oder lieber an Workflows verweisen? Oder wann EXPORT? Als Procedure oder lieber als Troubleshooting?)

#### Procedure

*Fulfillment > Dispatch notes > Tab LIST*

![Dispatch notes](../../Assets/Screenshots/Fulfillment/DispatchNotes/DispatchNotes.png "[Dispatch notes]")

1. Click the checkbox of the dispatch note to be reexported.
  The editing toolbar is displayed.

2. Click the [EXPORT] button.
  A confirmation window is displayed with the following notice is displayed: **One or more of the selected dispatch notes are not waiting for transfer! Exporting might produce errors in automated processes. Are you sure?*.

    > [Info] The [EXPORT] button should only be used in exceptional cases. Since the related workflow process would display an error, it is highly recommended to address this issue in the *Workflows* module, see [Retry a single process action](../../ActindoWorkFlow/Troubleshooting/01_RetryProcessAction.md#retry-a-single-process-action).

[comment]: <> (Unsicher. Wie kann man das Problem über Workflows lösen? Gibt es ein Action vorher, die man wieder anstoßen kann?) 

3. Click the [OK] button in the confirmation window.  
  An additional confirmation window notice is displayed.

4. Click the [EXPORT] button if you are sure you want to export the dispatch note again.
