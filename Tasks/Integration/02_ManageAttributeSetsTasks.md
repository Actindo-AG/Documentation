# Manage an attribute set for tasks

An attribute set consists of multiple attributes to classify certain entity type, in this case, a task. You may need to define different type of tasks, such as a basic task, a payment task, or an order task, such as the ones displayed in the example. 

![Tasks attribute sets](../../Assets/Screenshots/Tasks/Settings/AttributeSets/AttributeSetsTasks.png "[Tasks attribute sets]")

The fields you may want to include in each type of task will probably differ. For example, an order task will include an *Order reference* field, whereas a payment task will contain a *Payment reference* field that does not need to be included in the order task. 

The *ATTRIBUTE SETS* tab in the *Tasks* module equals the *ATTRIBUTE SETS* tab contained in the *DataHub* module. In the *Tasks* module, however, you can only manage the tasks-related attribute sets, as only the task-relevant attribute sets are displayed.

For detailed information on how to manage an attribute set, see [Manage an attribute](../../DataHub/Integration/02_ManageAttributeSets.md) in the *DataHub* documentation.
