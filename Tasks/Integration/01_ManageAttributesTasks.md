# Manage an attribute for tasks

A task is an entity type. Like all entity types, a task is defined through a series of attributes. In the *Tasks* module, you can create, edit, deactivate, and delete attributes that are specific to your tasks. 

The *ATTRIBUTES* tab in the *Tasks* module equals the *ATTRIBUTES* tab contained in the *DataHub* module. In the *Tasks* module, however, only the tasks-relevant attributes are displayed. 

For detailed information on how to create, edit, deactivate, and delete attributes, see [Manage an attribute](../../DataHub/Integration/01_ManageAttributes.md) in the *DataHub* documentation.
