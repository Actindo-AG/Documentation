# General information

The *Tasks* module offers an overview of all tasks that need to be performed manually by a user. It integrates seamlessly with the *Process Orchestration* module and allows the automatic creation of tasks when a certain event occurs. Most tasks are created automatically by modules, such as *Omni-Channel* or *Process Orchestration* (*Workflows*), for example, when a process fails. Tasks can also be added during the handling of processes in the *Process Orchestration* (*Workflows*) module, for instance, for manual clearance of suspicious orders or approving refunds.  

Tasks are related to an event, which can be assigned by default to a user as well as an user group. Many events are created automatically when installing a module or plugin, but you can also define your own events in the *Tasks* module.

All these features combined allow you to further customize your business processes to meet your specific needs, to automate them to reduce errors and optimize resources, and to keep a closer control of them.  

Besides, the *Email* module integration (*Task Tracker Email Connection* plugin 1.1.0) allows you to configure the email notifications per event every time a task is created.

This documentation refers to the *Tasks* (*Task Tracker*) module version 1.7.0. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Tasks* module is installed in a different version.
