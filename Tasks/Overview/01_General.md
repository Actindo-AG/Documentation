# General information

The *Tasks* module is a simple but effective tool to manage your tasks centrally. It offers an overview of all tasks created in the system and provides practical features to manage your to-do list easily. A multiple filter functionality allows you to filter the tasks by various criteria, such as assigned user or user group, task status or event, which can also be combined to narrow down your results.

It integrates seamlessly with the *Process Orchestration* module and supports the automatic creation of tasks based on configurable events. You can also define your own events and assign them to a responsible user or user group. Additionally, the *Email* module integration (plugin version 1.1.0) allows you to configure the email notifications per event every time a task is created.

This documentation refers to the *Tasks* module version 1.7.0. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Tasks* module is installed in a different version.
