# Key features

The *Tasks* module allows you to keep close track of your business processes:

- Manage all available tasks  
    You can filter all tasks by different criteria. For example, you can display those tasks assigned only to you, or to you as a member of a user group. You can jump directly to the plugin where the task originates via link to check further details, mark a task as done when completed, or reopen it if needed. You can also assign a task individually to a specific user if desired.  

- Manage the events  
    You can check all events created by the system and create new ones if necessary. Besides, you can assign an event by default to a user or a user group, who will take care of the related tasks.

- Define you email notification preferences   
    If the *Tasks-Email* integration is installed and set up, you can also determine in which events the responsible user or user group should be notified when an event-related task is created.
