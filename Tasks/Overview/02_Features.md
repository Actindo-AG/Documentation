# Key features

The *Tasks* module allows you to keep close track of your business processes:

- Manage all tasks centrally   
    Thanks to a multiple filter functionality, you can sort all available tasks by different criteria, allowing you to keep a better overview of the work to be done. You can easily assign open tasks to any member of your team to improve accountability and increase productivity. Complete your tasks, mark them as done or reopen them if needed just with a couple of clicks from the *Tasks* module.

- Determine your own task-triggering scenarios   
    The *Tasks* module allows you to define the events which will trigger the automatic task creation. Events can also be assigned by default to a user or a user group, who will take responsibility for the event-related tasks. 

- Define you email notification preferences   
    With the *Tasks-Email* integration, you can determine how the responsible user or user group should be notified when an event-related task is created.
