Enter the reference node path

/M_INVOIC_07A/G_INVOIC_07A_SG26




## Get line item segments

Get the line item segments of an EDIFACT message in order to be able to fill them.  
  
You can add constant values as well as strings that are to be determined via attribute mapping later. 


#### Prerequisites

- You have the message specification of your business partner at hand.
- You have created the basic definition settings for this type of message and business partner, see [Create basic definition settings](./01_ManageDefinitions.md#create-basic-definition-settings).

#### Procedure

*DataHub Exporter > EXPORTS tab*

![Exporter definitions](../../Assets/Screenshots/EDI/Operation/ExportDefinitions.png "[Exporter definitions]")

1. Click the definition for which you want to specify the line item settings.
    The *Edit definition "definition name"* view is displayed. The *Settings* tab is displayed by default.

    ![Edit definition](../../Assets/Screenshots/EDI/Operation/ExportDefinitionEditLineItems.png "[Edit definition]")

2. Click the *File settings* tab.

    BILD ERGÃ„NZEN MIT OHNE MESSAGE

3. Click the *Release* drop-down list and select the EDIFACT version to which you want to refer. Information on the relevant version is available in the implementation guide of your business partner.

4. Click the *Message type* drop-down list and select the message type which you want to set up, for example INVOIC.

5. Enter the *Reference node path*. Use the following syntax:    
    /M_<Message type, for example INVOIC>_<EDIFACT>_<version number (last three digits)>/ G_<Message type, for example INVOIC>_<EDIFACT>_<version number (last three digits)>_<Group name, for exampleSG27>*. 
    For example: /M_INVOIC_07A/G_INVOIC_07A_SG26*
    Alternatively, you can copy the two parts from the header file message structure. 
    *Note, depending on the EDIFACT version, the line items (LIN segment) are included in another group, for example the SG27 group.
    
    

5. Click the ![Get](../../Assets/Icons/Download.png "[Get]") [GET] button.   
    The *Reference node path* as well as the message is displayed. The message name is highlighted in red because it is still empty. It starts with the SG26 element. Note, in the header definition file settings, after saving, you are no longer able to expand the *G_INVOIC_07A_SG26* group.

6. Expand the message structure by clicking the ![Collapsed](../../Assets/Icons/NodeCollapsed.png "[Collapsed]") (Collapsed) button.   
    The message structure with its single segments is displayed, it starts with the S_LIN segment. The ![Collapsed](../../Assets/Icons/NodeCollapsed.png "[Collapsed]") (Collapsed) button has changed to an ![Expanded](../../Assets/Icons/NodeExpanded.png "[Expanded]") (Expanded) button.

## Specify line items

Start specifying the line item segments by filling out the single elements of the S_LIN (Beginning of message) segment. This procedure shows how to edit a constant text value, for example the transaction type *Commercial invoice* that specifies the type of the INVOIC message.

>[INFO] The following procedures show by using examples how to specify specific line item segments of the EDIFACT message. Follow the guidelines of your business partner when specifying the EDIFACT message!
