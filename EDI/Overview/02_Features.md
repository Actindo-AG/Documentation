# Key features

- In order to transfer EDIFACT messages to the receiver, the *DataHub Exporter* module is used. The module allows you to export *DataHub* entity data to various destinations. 
- The *XML/EDIFACT & UN/EDIFACT Exporter* plugin strictly adheres to the international UN/EDIFACT standard for EDIFACT message structures. All EDIFACT messages structures in all versions are available for easy configuration.  
- The messages are automatically transformed into the EDIFACT and the XML/EDIFACT standard by the ETL data mapping. The data mapping between your *Actindo* data and the fields of an EDIFACT message is an integral part of the message definition.
- You configure the EDIFACT and XML/EDIFACT messages and their contents with a visual representation that exactly matches the structure of the EDIFACT messages. You can always see if a mandatory segment has not yet been completed. A preview of the message output allows you to check your work at any time.
- You can export the messages in a manual process, time-controlled, or at any point in the business process.
