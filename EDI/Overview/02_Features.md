# Key features

- In order to transfer EDIFACT messages to the receiver, the *DataHub Exporter* module is used. The module allows you to export *DataHub* entity data to various destinations. 
- The *DataHub Exporter* module strictly adheres to the international UN/EDIFACT standard for EDIFACT message structures. All EDIFACT messages structures in all versions are available for easy configuration.  
- The messages are automatically transformed into the EDIFACT and the XML/EDIFACT standard by the ETL data mapping. The data mapping between your *Actindo* data and the fields of an EDIFACT message is an integral part of the message definition.
- You configure the EDIFACT and XML/EDIFACT messages and their contents with a visual representation that is based on the original structure of the messages.  
   You can fill in the necessary data for an EDIFACT message using a structured view that corresponds exactly to the structure of the EDIFACT messages. You can see at any time if a mandatory segment has not yet been completed. A preview of the message output makes it easier for you to check your work at any time.
- You can export the messages in a manual process, time-controlled, or at any point in the business process.
