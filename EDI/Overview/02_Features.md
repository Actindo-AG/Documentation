# Key features




- The *DataHub Exporter* module is used to transfer the EDIFACT messages.    
    The module allows you to generally export *DataHub* entity data to various destinations. 
- The EDIFACT message structures in the *DataHub Exporter* module exactly follow the internationally predefined UN/EDIFACT standard.
- All EDIFACT messages structures in all versions are available for easy configuration.  
- Automatic transformation of messages into the EDIFACT and the XML/EDIFACT standard.   
   The needed ETL data mapping between your *Actindo* data and the fields of an EDIFACT message is an integral part of the message definition.
- Visual configuration of EDIFACT and XML/EDIFACT messages and their contents.   
   You can fill in the necessary data for an EDIFACT message using a structured view that corresponds exactly to the structure of the EDIFACT messages. You can see at any time if a mandatory segment has not yet been completed. A preview of the message output makes it easier for you to check your work at any time.
- Export of the messages in manual process, time-controlled, or at any point in the business process.
