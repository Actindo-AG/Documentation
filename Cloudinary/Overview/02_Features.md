- Multiple connections
  The *Cloudinary* module enables to create multiple connections to different Cloudinary accounts.



## Simple connection setup

**Predefined drivers for a quick setup**
Benefit from all the functionalities that the Cloudinary integration brings in just a few minutes of setup time. Thanks to the predefined drivers, connection setup is simple and quick. All you need to do is enter the account details of your Cloudinary account and select the desired driver and you're ready to go. 

## Comprehensive meta data management

**Low effort, high customizability**
The metadata of the media files can be easily managed in Actindo. As soon as the connection to the corresponding Cloudinary account is established, the corresponding metadata fields from Cloudinary are synchronized in Actindo. In addition, further metadata fields can be created and edited directly in the *Cloudinary* module. Those metadata fields are transferred to Cloudinary after the connection is saved. The management of the metadata can therefore be done in Actindo on its own - an intermediate switch to the Cloudinary account is not necessary.
