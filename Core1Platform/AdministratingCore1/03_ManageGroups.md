# Manage user groups

Create admin group ->  Genau Ã¼berlegen, da Admins alle Rechte haben und daher Lizenzen verbrauchen

Note that user groups in opposite to the users are not global. Group rights are valid for the current instance only. This means that they are not shared between the main account and the sandboxes. 
If you add a user to a group, the user is automatically listed for this account. If you want to remove a user from an account, you need to remove the user from all groups.



# Manage the user rights

Manage the user rights to allow a user or a group of users to access specific data. User rights can be individually granted or denied pro query and pro query category to a user group based on their user role.
