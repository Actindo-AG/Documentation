# Manage users

A user is a global *Actindo* entity that is shared between the main account and the sandboxes. If you create a user in the main account, and you invite this user to a sandbox, the user dates are automatically available in this sandbox. If you change user data, the data are automatically synchronized with the sandboxes in which the user is assigned a user group.
You must create a user in the main account. It is not possible to create a user in a sandbox.   
> [INFO] As a user, you can change some data in a sandbox too. For detailed information, see [Edit profile settings](../UsingCore1/02_EditProfileSettings.md "Edit profile settings").
