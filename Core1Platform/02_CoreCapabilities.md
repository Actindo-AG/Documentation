The *Actindo Core1 Platform* provides you with the following:

- [Omni-channel integration](#omni-channel-orchestration)
- [Data transformation and process orchestration](#data-transformation-and-process-orchestration)
- [Monitoring and reporting](#monitoring-and-reporting)
 



## Omni-Channel integration

There are many ways to do digital commerce, including not only your own online store but also numerous marketplaces. However, managing products separately in each channel requires huge effort. With the *Omni-Channel* module, you can connect your web store and all relevant marketplaces as well as payment service providers directly to the platform and manage them centrally. You can integrate various store systems, such as Shopify or Magento 2.

## Data transformation and process orchestration

The data model of the *DataHub* module with ETL system (Extract, Transform, Load) allows maximum flexibility. It enables complex and varying data to be mapped, transformed, and transferred. The transfer is done via external services to other modules as well as external systems such as legacy ERP systems, marketplaces, payment and fulfillment providers, etc. 
You can customize your individual data fields and sources for every single process and "translate" them individually for their receivers.  

The Actindo *Workflows* module is a tool that allows you to design, control, map, and monitor your business processes. Based on your special and individual business rules, your company's processes and data can be mapped and made available however and whenever you want. You can easily adapt and automate processes in a graphical way and almost without any code needed. 


## Monitoring and reporting

Keeping track of all business areas is difficult when different systems and IT solutions are in use. As an overarching digital operations platform, the *Actindo Core1* integrates all the important processes of online commerce. The *DB and reporting* module enables you to provide an overview of various KPIs and statistics from all modules in one place.   
The Actindo *DB and reporting* module is a powerful tool to quickly access, retrieve, and manage all data contained in your system. You can individually configure the data output in different formats. You will no longer need to collect data coming from different data silos.    
For example, you can use a dashboard enabled by a Grafana&trade; integration. At a glance, it gives system administrators an overview on the system health, alerts, or the number of error messages. By visualization of time series data, it shows a sales representative the top sellers, the number of orders, or incoming orders after marketing activities.
