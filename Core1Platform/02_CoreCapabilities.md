## Standalone solution or modernization of legacy ERP systems

The *Actindo Core1 Platform* supports the business of companies in wholesale and retail, sale via marketplaces or social commerce. It treats online commerce the same as stationary trading. Each store is its own marketplace, each transaction at a pay desk an incoming payment or refund.  
The *Actindo Core1 Platform* is a complete interlocking solution. You can compose your individual platform by selecting only those modules you really need for your business.

### ERP system is not yet in use

If you have not yet an ERP system in use, the *Actindo Core1 Platform* can run as a standalone platform. The wide range of classic ERP features helps to digitize, automate, and optimize commerce processes. You can use it as all-in-one-solution to do the following:  
    - Maintain your business data and to do the accounting.   
    - Implement and monitor your commerce processes.   
    - Get, transform, and transfer data from service providers, shops, and fulfillment providers.   
    - Reporting on products, individual KPIs, and statistics.    
    - and much more...

### ERP system is in use

If there is an existing ERP system in use, the solution provides complete software for linking existing and legacy IT systems with modern markets in the B2C (Business to Customer) and B2B (Business to Business) sectors.   
The average age of running ERP solutions are about 12 years. This means in most cases that you are not able to quickly follow new evolutions in e-commerce with your legacy ERP system. Changing of processes and data models are then extremely time consuming and expensive.  
The flexible data models of the *Actindo Core1 Platform* enable varying data to be mapped, transformed, and transferred to other modules, your legacy ERP system as well as other third-party-systems. The direction of the data flow is thereby determined individually by the process orchestration.  
The *Actindo Core1 Platform* supports the transformation to a direct to consumer business with all benefits that provides running an own branded online shop. You can use the *Actindo Core1 Platform* to modernize your e-commerce, to stay up-to-date, and to implement new evolutions.  

## Omni-channel integration

There are many ways to do digital commerce, including not only your own online store but also numerous marketplaces. However, managing products separately in each channel requires huge effort. With the *Omni-Channel* module, you can connect your web store and all relevant marketplaces as well as payment service provider directly to the platform and manage them centrally. You can integrate various store systems, such as Shopify or Magento 2. <!---Magento heiÃŸt jetzt Adobe Commerce??-->  

## Data transformation and process orchestration

The data model of the *DataHub* module with ETL system (Extract, Transform, Load) allows maximum flexibility. It enables complex and varying data to be mapped, transformed and transferred. The transfer is done via external services to other modules as well as external systems such as legacy ERP systems, marketplaces, payment and fulfillment providers, etc. 
You can customize your individual data fields and sources for every single process and "translate" them individually for their receivers.  

The *Actindo Workflows* module is a tool that allows you to design, control, map, and monitor your business processes. Based on your special and individual business rules, your company's processes and data can be mapped and made available however and whenever you want. You can easily adapt and automate processes in a graphical way and almost without any code needed. 


## Business intelligence

The Actindo *Product Information Management (PIM)* module is the one source of truth for collecting, managing and enriching product data and thus the heart of all your sales channels. You will no longer need to collect data coming from different data silos. Developed according to the API-first principle, the Actindo *PIM* module can be quickly and easily integrated into existing system landscapes and serves as the basis for efficient unified commerce across all channels. Data silos are a thing of the past.    

Keeping track of all business areas is difficult when different systems and IT solutions are in use. As an overarching digital operations platform, the *Actindo Core1* integrates all the important processes of online commerce and thus enables the *Business Intelligence* module to provide an overview of various KPIs and statistics from all modules in one place. <!--mittels Grafana?-->
