# Innovative MACH+ architecture

The MACH+ approach is considered as fundamental for the newest generation of software and system integrators to quickly adapt new evolutions, trends, and technologies. It is an industry standard that describes modern technology: Microservices based, API-first, cloud-native SaaS (software-as-a-service) and headless. Our MACH+ certification gives enterprises confidence that they are choosing best-in-class vendors that can deliver future-proof technology.


### Microservices
The Actindo digital operations platform is composed of multiple independent services and can function both as a standalone solution as well as provide only the required components for an existing or a newly created IT landscape.   
With the help of pre-built e-commerce building blocks, your teams can easily create a customer-specific infrastructure. Furthermore, the teams can agilely scale and evolve the IT-framework as needed using a low-code approach. If you have a PWA (Progressive Web Apps) online shop or custom web interfaces and apps for your sales teams, you can quickly implement and improve any e-commerce solution. 


### Flexible APIs

Companies can accelerate innovation with modern APIs (application programming interfaces) and easy-to-use low-code development environment. With 500+ API endpoints, you can integrate existing backend systems or additional third-party applications. You can extend the platform to your needs &ndash; regardless of the front end of your customer's devices. 


### Cloud technology

Instead of worrying about maintaining, connecting, and updating a monolithic ERP software, you can use a fail-safe and scalable platform made in Germany. Our cloud servers are compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data is held in Germany in a high-security data center on our own 
servers (server housing) with a multi-level system for the control of access authorizations. The servers are located in Germany and can be accessed wherever you are.


### Headless Commerce 

The headless commerce architecture provides the decoupling of front-end user interfaces from back-end solutions. This allows all types of front ends ("heads") to evolve independently. As a result, it gives e-commerce executives the flexibility and freedom to create e-commerce experiences which are perfectly aligned with their business models and partners.
