# Highlighting in texts

The following list shows the meaning of different font formats in the Actindo documentation.

- **Bold**   
    Bold is used to emphasize the following:       
    - Entries in fields
    - Options in drop-down lists
    - Keystrokes
    - Subtitles (for example UI section names) which are no own heading, which means an own entry in the table of content.   

- *Italics*   
   Italics are used to emphasize the following:   
    - The name of a module/plugin
    - The names of menus, tabs, windows, or views 
    - UI element names (except for button names) and breadcrumb paths.   

- "Quotation marks"   
   Quotation marks are used to emphasize changing names which are included in the name of windows, views, fields, etc., such as "Attribute key" or "Workflow name". For example, the **Mapping from "Source attribute set name" to "Destination attribute set name"** view is displayed.
