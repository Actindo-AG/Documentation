# Key Features

Authenticate easily and securely:
- Strong protection     
  The user credentials are protected with strong public key cryptography and bound to the service. Since only the real site can authenticate with a key, this provides a high level of protection against account takeover.  

- No additional apps or software required  
  The *YubiKey* protects access to computers, networks and online services with a single touch.

- Convenient authentication with just a few steps     
  The authentication code is created via USB between the *YubiKey* and your device without further manual input steps.

- Make it simple
  The *MFA* can be perfectly combined with *Single Sign-On (SSO)*. This makes the login process not only more secure, but as simple as possible. For detailed information about *SSO*, see [SSO](../../SSO/Overview/01_General.md).
