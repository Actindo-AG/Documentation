# General information

The *Single Sign-On (SSO)* is an authentication method that enables the user to log in to one application or website and automatically be logged in to further websites and applications with a single set of credentials. Actindo supports *SSO* by using *Windows Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)*. Therefore, an organization administrator must configure *SSO* in *Azure AD*. Further, both, user data and certain data from *Azure AD*, must be gathered and transferred to Actindo so that the configuration of *SSO* can be completed by Actindo. After that, the user will log in to the Actindo Core1 Platform using *SSO*.

## Benefits

The *Single Sign-On (SSO)* offers the following benefits:
- One login for several platforms or applications.
