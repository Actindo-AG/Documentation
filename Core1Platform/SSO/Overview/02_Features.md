# Key Features

Login once for all applications:
- One set of credentials for everything   
    The users do not have to remember a large number of different passwords and user names for each application or service. Instead, they only have to remember one set of credentials to log and access the full suite of applications and services.

- Total independence   
    The *SSO* can be used regardless of the platform, the technology, or the domain the user is using. Once logged in to an application, the user is signed in to all other applications automatically.

- Simple and secure connection   
    The *SSO* can be perfectly combined with *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*, such as *U2F*. This makes the login process not only easier but also as secure as possible. For detailed information about *MFA*, see [U2F](../../MFA/Overview/01_General.md).
