# Innovative MACH+ architecture

The MACH+ approach is considered as fundamental for the newest generation of software and systems integrators to quickly adapt new evolutions, trends, and technologies. The *Actindo Core1 Platform* offers maximum flexibility, highest performance, and future proofing by using the four guiding principles of microservices, API-first, cloud-native, and headless. 


### Microservices

With the help of pre-built commerce building blocks, your teams can easily create a customer-specific infrastructure. Furthermore, the teams can agilely scale and evolve the IT-framework as needed using a low-code approach. Regardless if you have a PWA (Progressive Web Apps) online shop or custom web interfaces and apps for your sales teams, you can quickly implement and improve any commerce solution. 


### Flexible APIs

Companies can accelerate innovation with modern APIs (Advanced Programming Interfaces) and easy-to-use low-code development environment. With 500+ API endpoints, you can integrate existing backend systems or additional third-party applications. You can extend the platform to your needs &ndash; regardless of the front-end of your customer's devices. 


### Cloud technology

Instead of worrying about maintaining, connecting and updating a monolithic ERP software, you can use a fail-safe and scalable platform made in Germany. Our cloud servers are compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and are located in Germany.


### Headless Commerce 

The headless commerce architecture provides the decoupling of front-end user interfaces from back-end solutions. This allows all types of front-ends ("heads") to evolve independently. As a result, it gives commerce executives the flexibility and freedom to create commerce experiences that are perfectly aligned with their business models and partners.
