# Create ticket

## How to create a good ticket
In order to speed up the support process we ask you to consider the following points when creating tickets:

A descriptive reason
Good:
Delivery bills cannot be opened in the invoicing system
Bad:
Invoicing does not work
A detailed description
Include the following information:
- Under which menu item did the issue occur?
- What steps are needed to reproduce the behavior?
- Since when does the issue occur and does it occur regularly?
- How does the behavior deviate from the expected behavior?   

Give exact error message (ideally via screenshot)
Pictures/Videos   
Pictures/videos often say more than 1000 words. Please make sure that no personal data is visible. Ideally, the problem is color-coded and the entire Actindo interface is visible. You can upload attachments such as screenshots via the paperclip icon.
For security reasons, only file attachments in JPEG, PNG, PDF and CSV format are allowed.

Problems with communication with external systems (For example, stores)
Please specify the software used including version (for example, Shopware 5.3.1) as well as the connector version in case of online stores. 

For data protection reasons, please do not write any unsolicited access data in the ticket.
