# Edit profile settings

Your personal settings are stored in the profile settings.  You can change your user data as well as your password. Additionally, you can add or delete the U2F key, see [Set up U2F from the user side](#create-view "Set up U2F from the user side") for detailed information. 

> [INFO] The setup of the SSH key is also part of the profile settings. It is relevant for developers only and therefore not subject of this documentation.   



## Edit your user profile
The user profile contains information to your username, your e-mail address, and your address. Address data are subject to data protection. Clarify with your contact persons if you should provide your private address data.

## Change password
Depending on the user settings, it is possible to change the password for all sandboxes and the main account at the same time.  
Note, that your global user settings, edited by an administrator, may specify that you are not allowed to change your password. In this case, you cannot change your password. Contact your administrator, if you need to change your password for data security reasons.

   > [Info] A new password must fulfill certain requirements to be accepted. As a rule of thumb, use a password with at least 10 characters length and a combination of numbers, symbols (special characters), lowercase letters, and uppercase alphabetic characters. Further, you cannot use a password that you have used before.

5. Repeat the new password in the *neues Passwort erneut eingeben (Confirm password)* field. Your entries are not displayed. You can check them by clicking on the ![Change password](../../Assets/Icons/visibility_off.png "[Change password]")(visibility off) button.

Your entries are displayed. You can make them invisible again by clicking on the ![Visibility on](../../Assets/Icons/visibility.png "[Visibility on]") (visibility) button.

7. Click the [SAVE] button.   
If the entered password is valid, it is saved and the Password saved pop-up window is displayed.  


   ![Password saved](../../Assets/Screenshots/Core1Platform/ProfileSettings/Password/PasswordSaved.png "[Password saved]")

    The new password is now shared between the main account and all sandboxes of you company, so that you must use it for all Actindo logins.
