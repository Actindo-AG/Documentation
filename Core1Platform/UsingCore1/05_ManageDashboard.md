# Manage dashboards

An Actindo dashboard gives an overview of important key figures, statistics and system health information.   
Depending on the user role, different information might be relevant. While other modules have a predefined dashboard, you can configure multiple customized dashboards for the *Actindo Core1 Platform* that are adopted for different purposes.   

The number of dashboards is unlimited. A set of dashlets to be used is predefined for specific modules. A dashlet is an individual component that can be added or removed from a dashboard.


## Create a dashboard
