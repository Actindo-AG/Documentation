# Manage dashboards

The *Actindo Dashboard* module gives an overview of important module-specific key figures and statistics directly when starting the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. 
Depending on your user role(s), different information might be relevant, so that you can configure different dashboards for different purposes. Note that you configure dashboards for supporting your own daily work. They are not visible for other Actindo users.   
The number of dashboards is unlimited. For certain modules, a set of dashlets is predefined. A dashlet is an individual component that you can add or remove from a dashboard.


## Create dashboard

    > [Info] If you want to change the dashlet positioning, see [Change the dashlets arrangement](#change-the-dashlets-arrangement).


### Change viewport

Change the viewport to optimize the view of the dashboard for a specific device, for example, mobile, desktop, or tablet.
The viewport is saved for a single dashboard, so you can create dashboards with different viewports.   
Note that the size of a dashlet is fixed and will not be adjusted to the size of a specific device. For example, this means that a viewport for a mobile device should show only a few dashlets side by side so that it is not necessary to scroll horizontally to display the dashlets on the mobile device.

#### Prerequisites

A dashboard tab has been created, see [Create a dashboard](#create-a-dashboard).

#### Procedure
*Actindo Core1 Platform*

![NewTab](../../Assets/Screenshots/Core1Platform/UsingCore1/DashboardNewTab.png "[NewTab]")

1. Select the tab of the dashboard of which you want to change the viewport.   
    The selected dashboard tab is displayed.

    The *Edit tab* view is displayed.

    ![Edit tab](../../Assets/Screenshots/Core1Platform/UsingCore1/DashboardEditTab.png "[EditTab]")

3. Click the *Select viewport* drop-down list in the upper left corner and select the desired view format. The following viewports are available:
    - **Automatic**   
        The system automatically chooses the dashboard that has a suitable size for the current device. For using this function, it is necessary that you have created a viewport for all devices on which you use the dashboard.
    - **Mobile**   
        The dashboard size is optimized for a mobile device.  
    - **Tablet**   
        The dashboard size is optimized for a tablet device.
    - **Laptop**   
        The dashboard size is optimized for a laptop device. 
    - **Desktop**   
        The dashboard size is optimized for a desktop device.   

    The tab layout has been adapted to the selected view. The *Viewport loaded* notice is displayed in the footer.

4. Click the [SAVE] button.   
    Any changes to the dashboard have been saved. The *Edit tab* view is closed.
