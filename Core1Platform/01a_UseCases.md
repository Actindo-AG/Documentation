## ERP system is in use

If there is an existing ERP system in use, the solution provides complete software for linking existing and legacy IT systems with modern markets in the B2C (Business to Customer) and B2B (Business to Business) sectors.   
The average age of running ERP solutions are about 12 years. This means in most cases that you are not able to quickly follow new evolutions in e-commerce with your legacy ERP system. Changing of processes and data models are then extremely time-consuming and expensive.  
The flexible data models of the *Actindo Core1 Platform* enable varying data to be mapped, transformed, and transferred to other modules, your legacy ERP system as well as other third-party systems. The direction of the data flow is thereby determined individually by the process orchestration.  
The *Actindo Core1 Platform* supports the transformation to a direct-to-consumer business with all benefits that provides running an own branded online shop. You can use the *Actindo Core1 Platform* to modernize your e-commerce, to stay up-to-date, and to implement new evolutions.
