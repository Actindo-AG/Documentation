# Processes

The *Processes* menu entry allows to track a workflow process, that is, to check the status of a whole process or of individual actions, as well as the status and the content of a token. For detailed information about tracking a workflow process, see [Track the workflow process](ActindoWorkFlow/Operation/02_TrackWorkflowProcess.md).

It only contains the [OVERVIEW](./03a_Processes.md) tab.
