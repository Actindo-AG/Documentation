[!!Workflows](ActindoWorkFlow)

# Configure the queue types

Configure an arbitrary number of individual queue types to be able to execute certain actions faster. You can configure an unlimited number of queue types with a defined number of workers and a defined sequence of how actions are to be executed. The total number of workers that can be assigned to the queue types is limited by the number of booked vCores.
The *Default* queue type is predefined and is assigned to all actions by default. It can manually be overridden by individual queue types. A different queue type may be assigned for each action.


## Create a queue type

Create an individual queue type, assign a certain number of workers to it and define the sequence in which the actions are to be executed.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites to fulfill.

### Procedure

*Workflows > Queue Types > Tab OVERVIEW*

![Overview](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/Overview.png "[Overview]")

1. Click the ![Add](/Assets/Icons/Plus01.png "[Add]") (Add) button in the bottom right corner.   
  The *Create Queue Type* view is displayed.

  ![Create queue type](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/CreateQueueType.png "[Create queue type]")

2. Enter a name for the queue type in the *Name* field.

3. Enter the desired number of workers for the queue type in the *Number of workers* field.

  > [Info] A worker is a job executing the actions within a process. One worker can only execute one action at the same time. By assigning multiple workers to a queue type, this queue type may execute several actions at the same time. Consequently, actions with a queue type with more workers are executed faster that actions with queue types with fewer workers. The total number of workers of all queue types depends on the number of booked vCores.   
  For one worker, 4 vCores are needed. Additionally, 10 % of the booked vCores, but at least 4 vCores are blocked for the daily business and cannot be used for workers. The number of vCores needed always refers to the total number of workers in all queue types. For example, for a queue type with 2 workers and a queue type of 4 workers, 28 vCores are needed:   


4. Click the *Executing Prio* drop-down list and select the appropriate executing priority. The following options are available:
  - **Oldest executable action**: The oldest executable actions within all existing processes is executed first by the workers.
  - **Executable actions of oldest process**: The executable actions within the oldest process are executed first by the workers.


5. Click the [SAVE] button in the upper right corner.   
  The *Create Queue Type* view is closed. The new queue type is created and displayed in the list of queue types. The *QueueType has been created* pop-up window is displayed.

  ![Queue type created](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/QueueTypeCreated.png "[Queue type created]")

  > [Info] An error notice is displayed when the number of booked vCores is not sufficient to create the queue type with the selected number of workers.

## Kill workers

Sometimes it may be necessary to stop certain process actions. Therefore, you have to kill the workers to avoid that these actions are executed. You can either kill the workers of a single queue type or kill all workers regardless their queue type.

> [Warning] Problems may occur when killing workers. Only kill the workers when you are qualified to restart the stopped process actions.  


### Kill the workers of a single queue type

Kill the workers of a single queue types to stop all running actions of a certain queue type.

#### Prerequisites

At least one queue type is created, see [Create a queue type](#create-a-queue-type).

#### Procedure

*Workflows > Queue Types > Tab OVERVIEW*

![Overview](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/Overview.png "[Overview]")

1. Select the checkbox of the queue type whose workers you want to kill.    
The editing toolbar is displayed above the queue types list.

  ![Toolbar](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/Toolbar.png "[Toolbar]")

2. Click the [KILL WORKER OF THIS QUEUE TYPE] button in the toolbar.   
The workers of the selected queue type are killed. The process actions of the selected queue type will not continue until you restart the workflow processes. The *Worker will shutdown* pop-up window is displayed.

  ![Worker shutdown](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/WorkerShutdown.png "[Worker shutdown]")

### Kill all workers

Kill all workers to stop all currently running actions.

#### Prerequisites

At least one queue type is created, see [Create a queue type](#create-a-queue-type).

#### Procedure

*Workflows > Queue Types > Tab OVERVIEW*

![Overview](/Assets/Screenshots/ActindoWorkFlow/QueueTypes/Overview.png "[Overview]")

Click the [KILL WORKER] button above the queue types list.    
All workers are killed. The process actions will not continue until you restart the workflow processes. The *Worker will shutdown* pop-up window is displayed.
