# General information

The *Actindo Work Flow Engine (Workflows)* module is a tool that allows you to sculpt, control, map and monitor your business processes. Based on your special and individual business rules, your company's processes can be mapped and made available: from simple processes to complex workflows. As a result, you will always have an overview of your processes and can correct errors quickly and efficiently.

Over the last years, the system got more complex, less flexible and more error prone due to "cross-setting-behaviors". Instead of process-oriented endpoints based on the accounts configuration, model-based endpoints that perform exactly one operation on a given entity are now implemented and all of these endpoints become little building blocks. Using the *Workflows* module, these building blocks can be chained together in any way the customer likes.

The *Workflows* module offers the following benefits:
- More efficiency and flexibility via business processes overview
- Maximum control via real-time process display and detailed log
- Fully customizable through user-defined workflows
- Define specific business rules for any process or scenario

This documentation refers to *Workflows* module version 1.4.0. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Workflows* module is installed in a different version.
