# Manage the BWA reports

The business evaluation (BWA) is a reporting system based on company financial data and provides information about the company's current cost and revenue situation and, consequently, its  profitability. The BWA report serves as a basis for managerial future decisions, and it is widely used by capital investors and credit institutions for company assessment. The BWA is an essential planning and controlling tool for the company's future development.

The *BWA assignment* tab in the *Accounting* module enables to create a new BWA report, to copy one of the predefined system report or to delete any of them. All available reports can be completely customized.

Be aware, however, that the reports use the standard accounts set up in the *Accounting* module configuration process, see [Charts of accounts](01_RunAccountingWizard.md#chart-of-accounts). If the accounts have been customized manually, they will have to be set up again individually for the BWA reports. Otherwise, the BWA reports will not recognized them.
