# Manage the tax keys

Tax keys are a list of values, each of them linked to a specific tax rate. They are essential for the automatic tax functions, for example the automatic VAT tax booking. Every existing tax rate in the different accounts is assigned a tax key. The module *Invoicing* extracts data on the applicable tax rate from the tax keys.


### Prerequisites

- The accounting is configured via the configuration wizard.
- A valid fiscal year is created.

### Procedure

*Accounting > Settings > Tax keys*

You can create, edit, delete or restore your tax keys.   

![Tax keys](/Assets/Screenshots/Accounting/Settings/TaxKeys/Settings_TaxKeys.png "[Tax keys]")

> [Note] The buttons [SAVE] and [SAVE & NEW] have different functions and exclude each other. For this reason, they are not activated simultaneously.

### Create a tax key

1. Click on the button [CLEAR].   
The existing data are cleared. The button [SAVE & NEW] is now activated.

    ![Create a tax key](/Assets/Screenshots/Accounting/Settings/TaxKeys/TaxKeys_Buttons.png "[Create a tax key]")

   | (1) | Key |
   |-----|---------------------|
   | **(2)** | **Description** |

   | **(5)** | **Percent / Factor** |
   | **(6)** | **Accounts (VAT/VSt/VAT not due)** |
   | **(7)** | **VAT-ID needed** |
   | **(8)** | **Country** |
   | **(9)** | **SAVE & NEW** |
   | **(10)** | **CLEAR** |

2. Enter an available (unassigned) tax key in the field *Key*.

    > [Note] If you use a key that has already been assigned, an error message will be displayed.

6. Enter the appropriate data in the field *Percent / Factor*.

    > [Note] Companies selling products to foreign EU countries must be aware of the applicable VAT in the shipping country. It is recommended to check the validity of the tax rate in the corresponding country and update it accordingly in this field.

7. Enter the appropriate account(s) in the field *Account (VAT/VSt/VAT not due)*.

8. Click the drop-down list *VAT needed* and select the appropriate option (**No/Yes**).

10. Click the button [SAVE & NEW].  
The new tax key has been created.


### Edit a tax key

You can edit existing tax keys from the previously configured chart of accounts, for example if a tax percentage must be updated. Use the button [SAVE] to modify existing tax keys.

> [Warning] Be aware that the existing tax key will be then overwritten, that means, that the existing tax key will be completely replaced by the edited one.

The existing data for the selected tax key are displayed in the corresponding fields.

2. Edit the fields as appropriate. Click the button [SAVE].   
The tax key has been edited. The edited tax key is displayed in the list.


### Delete a tax key

You can delete tax keys that are not applicable to your business. You can also restore the originally configured chart of accounts.
