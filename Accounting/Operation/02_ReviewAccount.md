# Review an account

The balance is a figure representing the difference between credits and debits in an account. If the debit/credit totals are equal, the balance is settled. If a difference between them exists, there is an outstanding balance to be settled, for example, a payment must be made to bring the account balance to zero. The *BALANCES* tab offers a clear view of any outstanding balances in a selected account.

An account sheet, on the other hand, is a chronologically ordered list of all account movements in a specific account within a selected period of time. Accounts sheets can be later used for balance sheet calculations and profit and loss statements.

> [Info] When clicking the *BALANCES* and the *ACCOUNT SHEET* tabs for the first time, blank tabs are displayed. An account or contra account must be selected to display the corresponding details.
