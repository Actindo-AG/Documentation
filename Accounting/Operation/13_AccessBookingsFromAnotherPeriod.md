# Access bookings from another period

A fiscal year is the period over which a company's accounts are calculated, which generally lasts 12 months and which may or may not coincide with the calendar year.

A journal is a chronological record of all accounting transactions of a business within a specified period of time. There are two main types: general journals and special journals. Special journals are specialized lists of transactions records and can be freely determined by the bookkeeper. However, it is highly recommended to use the special journals configured in the system:

| Journal number | Definition |   
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Journals 1-12 | Bookings for months 1-12 |  
| Journal 90 | Balances carried forward bookings for financial accounts |  
| Journal 92 | Impersonal accounts, such as input tax and VAT balances |  
| Journal 93 | Carry forwards for P&L accounts |  
| Journal 98 | Debtors open items |  
| Journal 99 | Creditors open items |

The booking month is also relevant for the arrangement of bookings within a booking period. Calendar months, irrespectively of whether or not the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, are matched per default with the journals 1 to 12. This means, that the first month of a fiscal year will coincide with the journal 1, the second one with the journal 2 and so on.

Journal and months are used to arrange a company's business transactions within a fiscal year. A particular booking period, that is, a fiscal year and a journal, will only contain the bookings recorded in that specific period. Accessing bookings from other periods may be necessary, for example, if a booking from a previous booking period needs to be adjusted or if a transaction performed at a later stage must be manually booked in a specific period.
