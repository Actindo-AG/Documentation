# Provide the accounting data

The *Accounting* module offers an export function to export relevant data in different formats. Some of the most widely used financial formats for accounting software are supported.

Exporting data may be necessary to perform an external balancing of accounts and an annual financial statement, since the *Accounting* module does not offer this possibility. This is usually done at the end of a fiscal year.
