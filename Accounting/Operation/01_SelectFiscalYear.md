# Select the fiscal year

When you open the *Accounting* module for the first time after login or after reloading the system, the window to select a fiscal year is displayed. You have to select the fiscal year and the journal to display the bookings in the corresponding period. You cannot make any action in the *Accounting* module before selecting the fiscal year.

## Prerequisites

The accounting is configured, see [Run the accounting wizard](to_be_completed).

## Procedure
*Buchhaltung*

![Fiscal year](/Assets/Screenshots/Accounting/FiscalYear.png "[Fiscal year]")

1. Select a fiscal year in the drop-down list *Wirtschaftsjahr* .   
  The date fields *period* are filled in automatically.

2. Select a month in the drop-down list *Month* .

3. Enter a number for the journal number in the field *Journal*. Alternatively, click the button [LISTE] to display a new window with the available journals and their bookings.

  > [Info] The journal number corresponds to the number of the month, so all bookings of the month January can be found in the journal number 1, all bookings of the month February in the journal number 2 and so on.   
  Exceptions to this are special journals, such as the journals 90 to 99, which are defined in the accounting settings for balances carried forward.     

4. If required, select the checkbox ![checkbox](/Assets/Icons/checkbox.png "[checkbox]") *Festbuchungen übernehmen* and select a stack in the displayed list.

  > [Info] If the checkbox *Festbuchungen übernehmen* is selected, all fixed bookings in the selected stack will be automatically booked when opening the selected period in the fiscal year.   
  For detailed information about creating a fixed booking, see [Create a fixed booking](to_be_completed).

5. Click the button [OK] in the bottom right corner.   
  The menu entry *Buchen* with the tab *BUCHUNGEN* is displayed. The selected fiscal year and journal is preselected.
