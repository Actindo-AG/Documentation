# Delete bookings

The *Accounting* module allows to delete bookings in the *Bookings* tab, for example, if content errors are found or if the booking was created for test purposes.

It is possible to delete single bookings or multiple bookings at once. Bear in mind, however, that the bookings to be deleted must be unprocessed, that is, cannot have any related document, payment or cancellation running.

> [Warning] Be aware that any bookings deleted will no longer be available in the system.

## Delete a single booking
