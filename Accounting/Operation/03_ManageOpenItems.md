# Manage the open items

The *Open items* tab displays any open items in the system, that is, any business transactions that have not yet been completed. The open items function helps to monitor cash movements and avoid liquidity problems.

There are two view modes:

- If no account is selected, the *Open items* tab displays all open items in the *Accounting* module.
- If an account is selected, the *Open items* tab displays only the open items for the selected account.
