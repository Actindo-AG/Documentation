# Manage receipts

Receipts are used to document all transactions and, therefore, play an indispensable role for a correct accounting. There are many different types of receipts, such as invoice, order confirmation, or credit note. For detailed information about the different types of receipts, see [Invoicing / Types of receipts](#to_be_completed).
[comments]: <> (See alt_Doku)

The *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab allows to assign manually incoming receipts that have not been registered yet in the *Accounting* module. Providers can upload their invoices in PDF format in the *Documents* module, which will be then registered by the system and displayed in the *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab.

After being uploaded, the receipts are stored in the *New documents* folder in the *Documents* module. Once they are manually booked, they are moved automatically into the *Booked documents* folder and then placed in the appropriate subfolder according to the following structure:

- 10000-19999 account numbers in case of a debtors'/customers' document
- 70000-70999 account numbers in case of a creditors'/providers' document

Besides, when the receipt is booked in the *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab, it is linked to a particular booking. A blue B (=Beleg, EN: receipt) will be then displayed next to the booking in the bookings list. When clicking on the blue B, the corresponding receipt is displayed.
