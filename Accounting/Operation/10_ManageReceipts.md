# Manage receipts

Receipts are used to document all transactions and, therefore, play an indispensable role for a correct accounting. There are many different types of receipts, such as invoice, order confirmation, or credit note. For detailed information about the different types of receipts, see [Invoicing / Types of receipts](#to_be_completed).

[comments]: <> (See alt_Doku for reference)

The *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab allows to assign manually incoming receipts that have not been registered yet in the *Accounting* module. Suppliers can upload their invoices in PDF format in the *Documents* module, which will be then recognized by the system and displayed in the *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab.

[comment]: <> (Check with Heusel: 3 options to manage receipts: BELEGE BUCHEN, BELEG ZUORDNEN und extra Funktion LIEFERANTENBELEGE. ALLE unverbuchten Belege werden werden aber unter BELEGE BUCHE gezeigt, nicht nur externe Belege... Also, was ist der Unterschied zwischen BELEGE BUCHEN und LIEFERANTENBELEGE???)

After being uploaded, the receipts are stored in the *New documents* folder in the *Documents* module. Once they are booked, they are moved automatically into the *Booked documents* folder and then placed in the appropriate subfolder according to the following structure:

- 10000-19999 account numbers in case of a debtors'/customers' document
- 70000-70999 account numbers in case of a creditors'/suppliers' document

Besides, when a receipt is booked in the *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab, it is linked to the assigned booking. A ![Receipt](/Assets/Icons/Beleg.png "[Receipt]") icon will be then displayed next to the booking in the bookings list. When clicking on the ![Receipt](/Assets/Icons/Beleg.png "[Receipt]") icon, the corresponding receipt is displayed.

## Retrieve a receipt

[comment]: <> (Maybe change name to "Assign a receipt")

The [ASSIGN RECEIPT] button in the *BOOKINGS* tab allows to assign a receipt that has not been registered yet to an existing booking. Any unregistered receipts are displayed in the *BOOK RECEIPTS* tab and can be registered using this option. For detailed information about this procedure, see [Book a receipt](#book-a-receipt).
