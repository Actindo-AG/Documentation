*Warehousing > Quick posting > Tab POSTING HISTORY*

![Posting history](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/PostingHistory/PostingHistory.png "[Posting history]")

The *Posting history* tab allows you to check the stock postings for a specific material and to filter all stock postings according to different criteria. Since all stock postings ever performed are stored in the system, a huge number of entries is available. To reduce system overload and improve performance, no posting is displayed before setting a filter.

The list displayed when filtering by product is similar to the one displayed in the *Stock history* sub-tab of the *Warehouse/suppliers* tab in the *Quick posting* menu entry. 

The following filters are available:

- *Product*  
    Enter the product SKU or name to search for the stock posting for a specific material. 

- *Posting type*  
    Click the drop-down list and select the posting type you would like to display. The following options are available: 
    - **Manual posting**
    - **Reservation**   
    - **Waiting for picking**
    - **Sale**  
    - **Order**   
    - **Purchase**  
    - **Back to supplier**
    - **Stock adjustment posting**  
    - **Stock transfer**  
    - **Return**  
    - **Drop shipment** 
    - **Problem**  
    - **Pre-reservation**  

    For detailed information on the different posting types, see (./04_PostingTypes.md). 

- *Warehouse*  
    Click the drop-down list and select the desired warehouse. All available warehouses are displayed in the list.
