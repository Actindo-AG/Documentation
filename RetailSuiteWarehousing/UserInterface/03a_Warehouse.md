## Stock allocation  

*Warehousing > Settings > Tab WAREHOUSE > Tab Stock allocation*

The stock allocation table includes automatically all warehouses you have previously created as columns. Besides, all target channels configured in the system are listed in the *Target channel* column. Depending on your configuration, the displayed columns may vary. 

The stock allocation allows you to define the stock values to be displayed in the individual sales channels. The configured values are then transferred to the *Stock value* attribute of the corresponding product in the *PIM* module. This value is in turn transferred via *Omni-Channel* to the sales channel.

For detailed information to configure the stock allocation, see [Configure the stock allocation](../Integration/04_ConfigureStockAllocation.md).
