# Posting history

*Warehousing > Posting history*

The *Posting history* menu entry allows you to check the posting history for individual materials or to filter all stock posting according to different criteria, such as posting type, storage location, or date range.

It only contains the [POSTING HISTORY](./02a_PostingHistory.md) tab.
