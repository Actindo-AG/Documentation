# Configure the stock withdrawal matrix

The stock withdrawal matrix is designed to determine automatically from which warehouse and under which conditions stock is withdrawn. You can configure the following parameters: 

- Country of delivery: The country where the order is to be delivered.  
- Sales channel: The output channel via which you want to create offers, for example, the *Omni-Channel* module.  
- Account: The connection used in the *Omni-Channel* module, for example, Salesforce Commerce Cloud or POS.  
- Sub-account: The shop where the order is placed, for example, the online store in Germany or in the US.  
- Shipping provider: The shipping service provided, for example, in case of express delivery, the material can be taken from a warehouse, and in case of standard delivery, from a different one.  
- Warehouse: The specific warehouse from which the stock should be withdrawn.  
- Warehouse group: The warehouse group from which the stock should be withdrawn. This information is optional. If both warehouse and warehouse group are specified, the warehouse must be included in the warehouse group.

The stock withdrawal matrix is a so-called priority list, that is, a list of criteria arranged in descending order based on their priority. Therefore, the correct order of these criteria is crucial, as the system goes through them in the order they are listed, starting from the top, and stops checking them as soon as a matching criterion is found. For example, if two entries have the same matching criteria, the system withdraws the stock from the warehouse that comes first until there is no more materials in stock, and then it goes to the next one.
