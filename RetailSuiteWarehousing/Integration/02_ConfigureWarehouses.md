# Configure the warehouses

In contrast to a warehouse group, a warehouse is a specific storage area that can be assigned, or not, to a specific warehouse group. If a warehouse is not assigned to any warehouse group, it will be listed under the general *No warehouse group* in the left side bar. 

Warehouses can be created, edited and deleted.
