# Configure the warehouses

A warehouse is a subordinate storage area within a warehouse group used for a specific purpose, such as sales, returns, or blocked stock. A warehouse can be assigned, or not, to a specific warehouse group. If a warehouse is not assigned to any warehouse group, it will be listed under the general *No warehouse group* in the left side bar. 

Warehouses can be created, edited and deleted.
