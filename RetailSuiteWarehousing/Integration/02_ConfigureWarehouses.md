# Configure the warehouses

In contrast to a warehouse group, a warehouse is a specific storage area that can be assigned, or not, to a specific warehouse group. If a warehouse is not assigned to any warehouse group, it will be listed under the general *No warehouse group* in the left side bar. 

Warehouses can be created, edited and deleted.

The *Purchasing* module can calculate the suggested amount of a product that needs to be purchased from a supplier to replenish the stock level. If this option is activated, that is, set to **Yes**, the stock amount available in this warehouse will not be part of the calculation, that is, it will be ignored by the system.)

    The warehouse has been saved.
