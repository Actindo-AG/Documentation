# Manage the stock

The main purpose of the *Warehousing* module is to manage the stock, that is, to post stock in and release stock from the warehouse. Stock postings are usually performed automatically by the system after the applicable business document is created and processed. This is in turn determined by the workflow you have previously configured. Additionally, you can perform stock postings manually if necessary, see [Create a manual stock posting](#create-a-manual-stock-posting). 

Before you can post stock for a material, you have to activate the warehouse logistics for the corresponding product, see [Activate the warehouse logistics for a product](#activate-the-warehouse-logistics-for-a-product).



## Activate the warehouse logistics for a product

All products created in the *Actindo Core1 Platform* are displayed in the *Product list* in the *Warehousing* module. However, a product is not relevant for the warehouse logistics by default. To be able to post stock for a material corresponding to a specific product in the *Warehousing* module, you have to activate the warehouse logistics for that individual product. 

Once you have activated the warehouse logistics for a selected product, the *Warehouse/suppliers* sub-tab is displayed. As soon as a stock amount has been posted, the warehouse logistics cannot be deactivated for this product any more. 

Not all products displayed in the product list are actual items kept in stock. Warehouse logistics cannot be activated for the following products:  

- Master product  
    A master product is a superordinate (parent) entity that has subordinate (child) entities, that is, the product variants. A master product is an abstract entity that represents an object; the product variants, on the other hand, are the actual products, in all its variants, that are on sale. For example, the master product "T-shirt" can have different product variants, for instance a red T-shirt in M size and blue T-shirt in L size.

- Product bundle  
    A bundle is a set of products that are sold together. However, these are individual products that are managed independently in the *Warehouse* module. Bundle stock depends on the stock of the individual products included in the bundle. If one of the products is not in stock any more, the bundle cannot be sold.

    ![Add posting](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/QuickBooking/WarehouseSuppliers/WarehouseManagement/AddBooking.png "[Add posting]") 

4. Click the *Stock location* drop-down list and select the storage shelf where you want to post the stock. All available storage shelves for this material are displayed in the list.

5. Click the *Posting type* drop-down list and select the desired posting type. Depending on the option you select, the fields displayed below may slightly vary. The following options are available:

    - **Reservation**   
        Select this option if you want to reserve a material for an open order. This posting type does not reduce the actual, physical stock in the warehouse, but does affect the available stock calculation. A reservation can therefore result in a negative stock level.

    - **Sale**  
        Select this option if the ordered material has left the warehouse. This posting type reduces the actual, physical stock in the warehouse.  
        The *Customer name* and *Sale price net* fields are additionally displayed.

    - **Order**   
        Select this option if you have ordered additional materials from a supplier for restocking purposes. This posting type does not increase the actual, physical stock in the warehouse but does affect the available stock calculation.

    - **Purchase**  
        Select this option if you want to add purchased and received materials in the warehouse. This posting type increases the actual, physical stock in the warehouse.    
        The *Supplier* and *Purchase price net* fields are additionally displayed.

    - **Stock adjustment posting**  
        Select this option if you want to adjust the stock in the warehouse after stocktaking. This posting type affects the actual stock in the respective storage shelf.  
        
    - **Stock transfer**  
        Select this option if you want to post a redistribution of a material from a source storage shelf to a destination storage shelf. This posting type affects the actual stock in both storage shelves.    
        The *New stock location* drop-down list is additionally displayed. 

    - **Return**  
        Select this option if you want to post a returned material. If a material is available in more than one storage shelf, the returned material will be always posted to the primary storage shelf. This posting type affects the actual stock in the respective storage shelf. 

    - **Problem**  
        Select this option if you want to post a material that cannot be sold for any reason, for instance due to a defect. This posting type affects the actual stock in the respective storage shelf. 

    - **Pre-reservation**  
        Select this option if you want to post a reservation for an order that has not been received in the system yet, that is, there is no business document assigned to it yet. This can be the case, for example, when a customer places a product in the shopping cart. This posting type does not affect the actual nor the available stock in the warehouse. 

        > [Info] To be able to use pre-reservation posting in the system, your shop must support this function.  

6.  If you have selected the *Stock transfer* posting type, click the *New stock location* drop-down list and select the destination storage shelf. Otherwise, proceed to next step.

7. Check the material amount in the *Change* field and enter a different material amount if necessary.  
    The *Old stock*, *Old total stock*, *New stock* and *New total stock* fields are updated accordingly. All these fields are read-only and are updated automatically. 

    > [Info] Depending of the posting type, the sign changes. A positive value indicates that materials are added to stock. A negative value means that materials are removed from stock. The amount posted is in turn added to or removed from the old and new stock values.  

9. Click the *Posting date* field and enter the desired date with your keyboard. Alternatively, click the ![Calendar](../../Assets/Icons/Calendar.png "[Calendar]") (Calendar) button to select a date.

10. If desired, add a comment to the posting in the *Comment* field.

11. If you have selected the *Sale* or *Purchase* posting types, you can enter a customer or supplier name, as well as the net sale or purchase price in the corresponding fields.

12. Click the [SAVE & NEW] button.  
    The posting has been saved. The stock in the *Storage locations* and *Stocks* section is updated accordingly.  

    > [Info] You can also see all postings performed for the selected material in the *Stock history* tab, see [Check stock history](03_CheckStockHistory.md).

## Check the stock allocation for a material

You can check the stock allocation for a selected material from the product list.

#### Prerequisites

- The warehouse logistics has been activated for the selected material, see [Activate the warehouse logistics for a product](../Operation/01_ManageStock.md#activate-warehouse-logistics-for-a-product).
- The stock allocation has been configured, see [Configure the stock allocation](../Integration/04_ConfigureStockAllocation.md).

#### Procedure

*Warehousing > Quick posting > Tab QUICK POSTING*

![Product list](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/QuickBooking/ProductList.png "[Product list]")

1. Right-click the row with the material you want to check from the product list.   
    The context menu is displayed.

    ![Context menu](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/QuickBooking/ContextMenu.png "[Context menu]")

2. Click the *Display stock allocation* entry.    
    The *Display stock allocation* window is displayed.

    ![Context menu](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/QuickBooking/DisplayStockAllocation.png "[Context menu]")

3. Check the stock allocation values displayed. These values are the result of the calculations configured in the stock allocation table and are transferred to the *PIM* product and, via *Omni-Channel*, to the corresponding sales channel.  

    > [Info] Bear in mind that product bundles are not actually kept in stock as a single material, since they are a grouping of two or more individual products. For stock allocation purposes, this means that the stock allocation displayed for product bundles is the result of the stock allocation of the individual products included in the bundle but rounded down: if there are 3 materials in stock left and a bundle contains 2 of them, the bundle stock is 1, and not 2.


## Check the stock history for a material

You can check all stock postings that have been performed for a selected material. Stock postings can be done automatically, that is, by the system, and manually by the user. If a business document number is provided in the *Document no.* column, the stock posting is automatic. If no business document number is displayed, the stock posting is a manual one.

The list displayed in this tab is similar to the one you obtain when searching for the stock postings for a material in the *Posting history* menu entry, see [Search for stock postings for a material](./03_CheckPostingHistory.md#search-for-stock-postings-for-a-material).
