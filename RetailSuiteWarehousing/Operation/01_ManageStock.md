2. Click the *Stock location* drop-down list and select the storage shelf where you want to post the stock. All available storage shelves for this material are displayed in the list.

3. Click the *Posting type* drop-down list and select the desired posting type. The following options are available:

    - **Reservation**   
        Select this option if you want to reserve a material for an open order. This reservation does not reduce the real, physical stock, only the available stock. A negative stock level can therefore result from a reservation.

    - **Sale**  
        Select this option if the ordered material has left the warehouse. This posting reduces the real, physical stock in the warehouse.

    - **Order**   
        Select this option if you want to ... This reservation ...

    - **Purchase**  
        Select this option if you want to add any purchased material to the warehouse. This posting increases the real, physical stock in the warehouse.

        [comment]: <> (physical oder available stock?)

    - **Stock adjustment posting**  
        Stock in, release from lager

    - **Stock transfer**  
        Select this option if you want to post a redistribution of a material from a source storage shelf to a destination storage shelf. If you select this posting type, the *New stock location* drop-down list is displayed.

    - **Return**  
        Select this option if you want to post a returned material. If a material is available in more than one storage shelf, the returned material will be always posted to the primary storage shelf.

    - **Problem**  
        Select this option if you want to post ...

    - **Pre-reservation**  
        Select this option if you want to post a reservation for an order that has not been received in the system yet, that is, there is no business document assigned to it yet. This can be the case, for example, when a customer places a product in the shopping cart.

3.  If you have selected the *Stock transfer* posting type, click the *New stock location* drop-down list and select the destination storage shelf. Otherwise, proceed to next step.

4. Check the material amount in the *Change* field and enter a different material amount if necessary. 

    > [Info] Bear in mind that, depending of the posting type, the sign changes. A positive value means a receipt of materials, whereas a negative value means the dispatch of materials.
