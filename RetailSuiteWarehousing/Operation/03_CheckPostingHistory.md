# Check the posting history

You can check all stock postings that have been performed in the *Warehousing* module. Stock postings can be done automatically or manually. If the business document number and customer/supplier details are provided in the corresponding columns, the stock posting is automatic. If this information is not displayed, the stock posting is a manual one. 

For detailed information about how to create a manual posting, see [Create a manual stock posting](./02_ManageStock.md#create-a-manual-stock-posting).

For a detailed description of all posting types and the automatic posting process, see [Posting types](../UserInterface/04_PostingTypes.md).

The *Posting history* tab allows you to check all stock postings created for a specific material and to filter all stock postings according to different criteria.

Besides, you can further filter the list of postings for a selected material by different criteria to narrow down your results, see [Filter the posting history by different criteria](#filter-the-posting-history-by-different-criteria).
