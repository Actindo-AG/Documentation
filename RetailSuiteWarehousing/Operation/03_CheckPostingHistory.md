# Check the posting history

You can check all stock postings that have been performed in the *Warehousing* module. Stock postings can be done automatically or manually. If the business document number and customer/supplier details are provided in the corresponding columns, the stock posting is automatic. If this information is not displayed, the stock posting is a manual one. 

The system performs the postings automatically when an order is received in the *Order Management* module. In the case of customer orders, the automatic posting process works as follows:

Every order that is imported into the system is linked to a business document, the head document. The head document, regardless of what business document it is, creates a reservation posting in the *Warehousing* module. The ordered material is then reserved. This reservation has no effect on the actual physical stock, but it reduces the available material stock, that is, the number of units that are available to be sold.

When the so-called delivery head, usually the delivery note, is created, this business document creates two postings in the stock history. The first one is a reserved for open delivery note posting (also known as waiting for picking) to withdraw the physical stock in the system, thus reducing the physical stock in the warehouse. The second one is a reservation posting with a negative sign to clear the initial reservation. The result of all materials processed in the order must always be 0.

Once the material has left the warehouse, that is, the delivery note has been closed, the reserved for open delivery note posting is updated into a sale posting.

For detailed information on the different posting types and their particularities, see [Posting types](../UserInterface/04_PostingTypes.md).

The *Posting history* tab allows you to check all stock postings created for a specific material and to filter all stock postings according to different criteria.



## Check the posting history for a material

You can check all stock postings created for a specific material. The list displayed is similar to the one displayed in the *Stock history* sub-tab in the *Warehouse/suppliers* tab for a selected material, although additional information is provided here, such as the order number in shop.

Besides, you can further filter the list of postings for a selected material by different criteria to narrow down your results, see [Filter the posting history by different criteria](#filter-the-posting-history-by-different-criteria).
