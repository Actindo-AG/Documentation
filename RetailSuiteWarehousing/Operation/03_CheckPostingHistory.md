# Check posting history

You can check all stock postings that have been performed in the *Warehousing* module, both automatically, that is, by the system, and manually by the user. If a business document number is provided in the *Document no.* column, the stock posting is automatic. If no business document number is displayed, the stock posting is a manual one.

It is possible to search all stock postings performed and filter them according to different criteria.


#### Prerequisites

At least a stock posting has been performed, see [Create a manual posting](./01_ManageStock.md#create-a-manual-stock-posting).  

#### Procedure


*Quantity* column


> [Info] Bear in mind that the plus/minus signs are reversed here. 



> [Info] If a posting is red-colored and crossed out, it indicates that the business document has been cancelled.
