# Execute the managed queries

Once the queries have been predefined, they can be executed. When executing a query, the query results can be provided in CSV or XML format, either as a download file or as a preview.

Depending on the options that have been enabled in the query, a query can be executed via API or via download link. Besides, the managed queries may only be executed by users who have been granted the applicable access rights. For detailed information, see [Manage the user rights](../Integration/05_ManageUserRights.md).
