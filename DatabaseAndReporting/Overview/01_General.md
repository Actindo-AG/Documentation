# General information

The *Actindo Database and reporting* module is a powerful tool to quickly access, retrieve and manage all data contained in your system. SQL, which stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is used to communicate with your databases. Its applications range from selecting and retrieving data, to altering table structures and updating contents, to name just a few. It also allows you to create predefined queries to determine who and how can access your data. Moreover, a connection with InfluxDB can be established to write your data into time series databases, which can be in turn visualized and monitored using Grafana.
