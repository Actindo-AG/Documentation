# General information

The Actindo *Database and reporting* module is a powerful tool to quickly access, retrieve and manage all data contained in your system. SQL, which stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is used to communicate with your databases. Its applications range from selecting and retrieving data to altering table structures and updating contents, to name just a few.
