# Key features

Access, retrieve and manage all your data quickly and centrally with the Actindo *Database and reporting* module:

- Access all your databases via the SQL console   
    SQL queries can be executed directly in the interactive console to retrieve any data contained in your databases. Both read-only and write operations are supported.  

- Define specific queries to be executed by different user groups   
    Specific queries can also be predefined to determine the data that can be accessed by the different user groups. User rights can be individually granted based on user roles. Data can be accessed via API or public download and output in XML or CSV format.

- Write your data into time series databases to track data changes over time  
    Through the use of InfluxDB technology, connected through a driver to the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, your data can be written into time series databases at regular fully-customizable intervals. This allows you to track data over time, as well as to identify and monitor trends.    

- Create data visualizations with Grafana  
    To round it all up, InfluxDB time series databases can be converted into graphs and visualizations using the Grafana open-source platform, which can be additionally integrated in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*.
