# Key features

Access, retrieve, and manage all your data quickly and centrally with the Actindo *Database and reporting* module:

- Access all your databases via the SQL console   
    SQL queries can be executed directly in the interactive console to retrieve any data contained in your databases. Both read-only and write operations are supported.  

- Define specific queries to be executed by different user groups   
    Specific queries can also be predefined to determine the data that can be accessed by the different user groups. User rights can be individually granted based on user group profiles. Data can be accessed via API or public download and output in XML or CSV format.

- Write your data into time series databases to track change over time  
    Through the use of InfluxDB&trade;[^1] technology, connected via driver to the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, your data can be written into time series databases at regular fully-customizable intervals. This allows you to track data evolution over time, as well as to identify and monitor trends.    

- Create data visualizations with Grafana&trade;  
    Last but not least, InfluxDB&trade; time series databases can be converted into graphs and visualizations using the Grafana&trade; open-source platform, which can be additionally integrated in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*.
