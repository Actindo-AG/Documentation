## Grant access rights to a user group

Assign user access rights to control access to specific data. The following access rights must be individually granted to any user group with a role other than administrator:

- **Execute query via API**  
    The users can execute a managed query via API if this option has been enabled in the query. Additionally, access rights must be granted for each individual predefined query.    
- **Queries**   
    Depending on the access permission type granted, the users can read, create, update, delete, and execute queries. 
- **Query categories**  
    Depending on the access permission type granted, the users can read and save query categories.
- **InfluxDB&trade;[^1]**  
    Depending on the access permission type granted, the users can create, edit, list, delete, and execute time series databases.
- **Interactive MySQL console**  
    The users can execute any query in the MySQL interactive console. Bear in mind that this gives the users access and even write access to all available data. 

    > [Info] Depending on the access rights granted, the user interface of the *Database and reporting* varies. That is, a user with no access right to the MySQL console cannot see the corresponding menu entry in the system.

#### Prerequisites

- A user group has been created.
- The users to be granted access have been added to the applicable user group.
