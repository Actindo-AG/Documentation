# Manage the time series groups

The time series databases can be organized in groups to execute them at certain time intervals or under specific scenarios. The time series databases assigned to a group are then executed sequentially, thereby reducing system load. Different groups running at the same time interval are executed in parallel.  

## Create a time series group

Create a time series group to group together any number of time series databases and determine the desired time interval to execute them.

#### Prerequisites  

No prerequisites to fulfill.

#### Procedure

*Database and reporting > Managed queries > Tab TIME SERIES GROUP*

2. Enter a descriptive name for the time series group in the *Title* field.

3. Enter a valid cron expression in the *CronLine* field to specify the time interval in which the time series databases included in the group are to be executed. If you need help creating a cron expression, you can check a cron expression editor, such as [Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/).

4. Click the [SAVE] button in the upper right corner.  
    The *Submitting data...* view is displayed shortly while saving. The times series group has been saved. The *Create time series group* view is closed. The new times series group is displayed in the list of time series groups.

Once a time series group has been created, it can be edited to change any previously set values.

#### Prerequisites

    The *Submitting data...* view is displayed shortly while saving. The changes have been saved. The *Edit time series group* view is closed. The edited time series group is displayed in the list of time series groups. 



## Delete a time series group

A time series group can be deleted if it is no longer in use.

#### Prerequisites
