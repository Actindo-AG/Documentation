**List of InfluxDB time series**

- ![Search](../../Assets/Icons/Search.png "[Search]") (Search)   
    Click this button to display the search bar and search for an InfluxDB time series. 

- ![Refresh](../../Assets/Icons/Refresh01.png "[Refresh]") (Refresh)   
    Click this button to update the list of InfluxDB time series. 

- ![Columns](../../Assets/Icons/Columns.png "[Columns]") Columns (x)   
    Click this button to display the columns bar and customize the displayed columns and the order of columns in the list. The *x* indicates the number of columns that are currently displayed in the list.

- [x]     
    Select the checkbox to display the editing toolbar. If you click the checkbox in the header, all queries in the list are selected.

- [EXECUTE]  
    Click this button to execute the InfluxDB time series immediately, that is, without waiting for the next scheduled run. This button is only displayed if a single checkbox in the list of InfluxDB time series is selected.

- [EDIT]  
    Click this button to edit a selected InfluxDB time series. This button is only displayed if a single checkbox in the list of InfluxDB time series is selected. The *Edit InfluxDB time series* view is displayed, see [Edit InfluxDB time series](#edit-influxdb-time-series).

- [DELETE]  
    Click this button to delete a selected InfluxDB time series. It is possible to delete several InfluxDB time series at once. This button is displayed if at least one checkbox in the list of InfluxDB time series is selected.

[comment]: <> (Funktioniert so wie bei Queries? Bitte best√§tigen.)

The list displays all InfluxDB time series. Depending on the settings, the displayed columns may vary. All fields are read-only. 

- *Title*  
    Description of the InfluxDB time series.

- *CronLine*  
    Cron expression used to specify the time interval in which the InfluxDB time series must be executed.

- *Connection*  
    Connection selected to write data to InfluxDB.

- *Query*  
    Predefined query to be executed in the InfluxDB time series.

- *Measurement*  
    Name of the table where the data is to be written.

- *Tags*  
    Tags specified to categorize the data written to InfluxDB. Tags are optional and therefore this column may be empty.

- *Fields*  
    Values specified to be written to InfluxDB. Fields are mandatory. 

[comment]: <> (Stimmt das so, dass Tags Spalte leer sein kann, Fields aber nicht?)

- *ID*  
    InfluxDB time series identification number. The ID number is automatically assigned by the system.

- ![Add](../../Assets/Icons/Plus01.png "[Add]") (Add)   
    Click this button to create an InfluxDB time series. The *Create InfluxDB time series* view is displayed, see [Create InfluxDB time series](#create-influxdb-time-series).  


## Create InfluxDB time series

*Database and reporting > Managed queries > Tab INFLUXDB TIME SERIES > Button Add*

![Create InfluxDB time series](../../Assets/Screenshots/DatabaseAndReporting/ManagedQueries/InfluxDBTimeSeries/CreateInfluxDBTimeSeries.png "[Create InfluxDB time series]")
