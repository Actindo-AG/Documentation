# Manage settings in Adyen

The following procedures contain information on the settings to be configured in the Adyen&trade; backend. It shows the standard procedures and screens that were current at the time this documentation was created. For the latest detailed descriptions, refer to the Adyen&trade; documentation. 

In addition to the credentials settings in the Adyen&trade; backend, the same data is required in the *Payments* module to ensure a smooth data transfer. Note that once you have saved the credentials in Adyen&trade; or the *Payments* module, you can no longer copy them in order to specify them on the other side of the connection. Therefore, we recommend that you enter the connection data in parallel, which means alternately in the *Payments* module and in the Adyen&trade; backend. Alternatively, you can cache the credentials in a file. For detailed information on the Payments settings, see also [Configure Adyen connection](./02_ManageAdyenConnection.md#configure-adyen-connection).

Note the following: 

- Adyenâ„¢ offers the possibility to work with two separate environments, a staging environment for testing purposes and a live environment for production. You must configure the connection for each environment separately.   
- If you have more than one merchant account in Adyen&trade; that you want to manage with Actindo, you must create connections for each.   


**Additional information**   

Adyen&trade; uses TLS certificates that are changed from time to time. Adyen&trade; users will be informed about this. You can ignore this information from Adyen because Actindo only checks if the certificates are valid in general and does not validate specific certificates. See also an update example from Adyen&trade;: [TLS Certificates on Adyen services](https://help.adyen.com/updates/tls-certificates-on-adyen-services "[https://help.adyen.com/updates/tls-certificates-on-adyen-services]"). 



## Create Adyen webhook

Create a webhook to receive payment notifications from Adyen&trade; to the *Payments* module such as authorizations and cancellations. For detailed information, see also [Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/ "[https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/]") in the Adyen&trade; documentation. It includes a video that may be helpful, too.


#### Prerequisites

- You have an Adyen&trade; customer account to log in to Adyen&trade;.
- You are logged in to Adyen&trade;.
- You are assigned to the required user roles in Adyen&trade;. 
- The *Adyen* plugin is installed on the *Actindo Core1 Platform* system.
- At least one Adyen&trade; connection has been created in the *Payments* module, see [Create Adyen connection](./02_ManageAdyenConnection.md#create-adyen-connection).
- You are logged in to your Actindo instance under *Payments > Settings > Select connection > Credentials tab*.

## Define synchronous or asynchronous processing

Define whether you want to transfer the payment data using synchronous or asynchronous processing. 
- At synchronous processing, Adyen&trade; creates a connection for each event that occurs. This has the advantage that Adyen&trade; is immediately informed if a message cannot be processed. The disadvantage is that the message transfer might be slow if a lot of events are to be transferred. See also [Blocked queue at synchronous processing](../Troubleshooting/01_SynchronousProcessing.md) in the Troubleshooting chapter.   
- At asynchronous processing, a message is not processed directly so that a lot of traffic can be handled. The message is first accepted and roughly checked for plausibility. It is then written to a message queue. After that, the message queue is processed periodically and can be run with parallel jobs. 


#### Prerequisites

- You have an Adyen&trade; customer account to log in to Adyen&trade;.
- You are logged in to Adyen&trade;.
- You are assigned to the required user roles in Adyen&trade;.


#### Procedure

*Adyen&trade; Backend > Developers > Webhooks*

![Webhook configuration in Adyen](../../Assets/Screenshots/Adyen/Integration/AdyenWebhooks.png "[Webhook configuration in Adyen]")

1. Click on your standard webhook.

2. Expand the *Server configuration* setting in the *General* section.

    ![Define server configuration](../../Assets/Screenshots/Adyen/Integration/AdyenChangeWebhookServerConguration.png "[Define server configuration]").

3. Configure the server URL as follows:   
    - If you want to process the messages asynchronously, add an **Async** to the address. For example: `https://customeraccount.dev.actindo.com/Actindo.Extensions.Actindo.Adyen.Notification.notificationAsync`.

    - If you want to process the messages synchronously, add a **2** to the address. For example: `https://customeraccount.actindo.com/Actindo.Extensions.Actindo.Adyen.Notification.notification2`.

4. Click the [Apply] button.   
    The synchronous or asynchronous processing has been defined.

5. Click the [Save changes] button in the bottom right corner.
