# Manage Adyen settings

In addition to the settings in the *Payments* module, there are some settings necessary in the Adyen backend to ensure a smooth data transfer.



## Declare notification user and password

In the Payments connection credentials, you have the credentials for the notification user. You must declare these credentials also in the Adyen backend settings, so that you can get notifications from Adyen.


#### Prerequisites

You have defined the credentials for the notification user, see [Configure Adyen connection](./01_ManageAdyenConnection.md).
