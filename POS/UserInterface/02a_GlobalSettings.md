# Global settings

*POS > Management > Tab GLOBAL SETTINGS*

In the *GLOBAL SETTINGS* tab, you define basic settings for all your stores.

> [Info] Global settings are valid for all stores as long as no different settings are defined for the respective stores or pay desks.

In principle, the more specific setting always overrides the more general setting.

![Global Settings](../../Assets/Screenshots/POS/Management/GlobalSettings/GlobalSettings.png "[Global Settings]")

In the left part of the page, the selection list *Settings* is displayed. The list is divided in the following sections:
- [GENERAL](#general)

- [RETURNS](#retouren)
- [RECEIPT PRINT](#belegdruck)
