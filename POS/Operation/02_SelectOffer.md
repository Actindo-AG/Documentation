# Select an offer

The *POS* module offers several ways to select an offer or to search for it.
You may select an offer by the following:
- Quickselect, see [Select by QuickSelect](#select-by-quickselect).
- Name, see [Select by name](#select-by-name).
- Number, see [Select by number](#select-by-number).

The different options are described in the following.

## Use single scan

If the same offer is selected more than once, it is displayed in the bill list as one line item with the corresponding quantity indication.     
Optionally, you can use the single scan feature. By using it, each offer is listed as a single line item in the bill list, even if it is the same offer. This allows you to treat each product in the bill list individually, for instance, to apply an individual discount.

#### Prerequisites

Offers for POS are created, see [Manage offers for POS](../Integration/07_ManageOffers.md).

#### Procedure

*POS > Sales > Select store and pay desk > Tab CASHPOINT*

![Cashpoint](../../Assets/Screenshots/POS/Sales/Cashpoint/Cashpoint.png "[Cashpoint]")

1. Enable the ![Toggle](../../Assets/Icons/Toggle.png "[Toggle]")*Single scan* toggle in the bill list on the right side of the pay desk interface.   

    > [Info] The single scan works from the moment it is enabled. It does not apply backwards to products that were already on the bill list at the time of activation.

    Even if the single scan function is active, you can edit the quantity of products manually in the bill list, see [Edit the quantity of a product](./03_EditBillList.md#edit-the-quantity-of-a-product).

2. Select an offer, see below. 
    The product is listed in the bill list.

3. Select the same offer again.   
    The same product is listed in an own entry in the bill list.
