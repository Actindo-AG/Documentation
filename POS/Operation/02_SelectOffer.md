# Record the purchase

The *POS* module offers several ways to select an offer and to search for it. Additionally, you can prepare further actions for editing the bill list &ndash; and to ensure the protection of minors.  



## Use single scan

If the same offer is selected more than once, it is displayed in the bill list as one line item with the corresponding quantity indication.     
Optionally, you can activate the single scan feature before you select the offers. By using it, each offer is listed as a single line item in the bill list, even if it is the same offer. This allows you to treat each offer in the bill list individually, for instance, to apply an individual discount.

#### Prerequisites

Offers for POS are created, see [Manage offers for POS](../Integration/07_ManageOffers.md).

#### Procedure

*POS > Sales > Select store and pay desk > Tab CASHPOINT*

1. Enable the ![Toggle](../../Assets/Icons/Toggle.png "[Toggle]")*Single scan* toggle in the bill list on the right side of the pay desk interface.   

    > [Info] The single scan works from the moment it is enabled. It does not apply backwards to offers that were already on the bill list at the time of activation.

    Even if the single scan function is active, you can edit the quantity of offers manually in the bill list, see [Edit the quantity of a product](./03_EditBillList.md#edit-the-quantity-of-a-product).

2. Select an offer, see [Select an offer](02_SelectOffer.md#select-an-offer).   
    The product is listed in the bill list.

3. Select the same offer again.   
    The same product is listed in an own entry in the bill list.
