# General information

With the cloud-based POS system of the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, you can not only control your online channels via Actindo, but also easily integrate your offline stores. The *Venduo POS* module enables digital and centralized management of your physical stores directly through the platform, dissolving obstructive boundaries between digital and classic commerce.  

This documentation refers both to the *Venduo POS* module version <!--?-->4.1.0. and the *UCS Sync for POS* plugin version 4.0.1. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Venduo POS* module is installed in a different version.

## Benefits

The *Venduo POS* module offers the following benefits:
- Track your stock overview and inventory changes in real time.
- Increase the control and transparency of your sales through a direct connection to our accounting module in the Actindo Core1 Platform.
- Set up multiple stores and cash registers.
- Local independence despite retail store: the cloud-based POS is digitally available from anywhere.
