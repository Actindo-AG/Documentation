# Key features

Successfully digitize your point of sale:
- Complete checkout system   
  The *Venduo POS* module of Actindo offers a complete checkout system with all necessary functions, such as flexible payment methods, returns management or voucher handling. It also enables a digital connection to all your physical stores.  

- Follow stocks centrally and in real-time   
   By connecting the *Venduo POS* system to the Actindo Core1 Platform, stock changes are always displayed in real time and you have an overview of all stock levels in one central location.

- Connect all stores and cash registers   
  You have the option to link all your stores and cash registers and manage them centrally via the platform. This way you will have an overview of your stock in real-time and track every sale. Pop-up stores can also be easily connected. The assortment for each store can be then controlled from our *PIM* module. You can assign complete user history, such as log-in and log-out data, sales data and stocks to the individual POS systems as well as to users.

- Central data management   
  With automatic data storage and retention, the *Venduo POS* module generates your sales, personnel, and customer data and makes it available centrally on the platform. This way, product data and customer purchasing behavior can be viewed holistically and evaluated more efficiently.  

- Direct link to accounting and invoicing    
  All sales data including products, turnover and means of payment from your cash registers are transmitted directly and in real time to accounting and billing in the Actindo Core1 Platform. Orders and returns from stores are thus displayed together with your online channels.  

- Independence through cloud POS    
  The *Venduo POS* system is cloud-based and therefore available from anywhere on mobile devices. Physical cash drawers and payment terminals can also be controlled from the cloud POS.  


## Create unified customer experiences

**Holistic shopping experiences from a single source**  
Control all sales channels and touchpoints centrally from the Actindo Core1 Platform. With the help of the *Venduo POS* module you can connect your stores to the platform and view, manage and process assortment, inventory and sales data. This simplifies your business processes and ensures a consistent shopping experience for your customers across all digital and physical touchpoints.  


## Digitize all retail processes

**Digitize store branches**   
Digitizing your business doesn't stop at your online store: The *Venduo POS* module offers you the possibility to also integrate your offline stores as well as your pop-up stores into the platform and thus digitally support sales processes. Manage your sales data and returns over the system, analyze product and customer data, track user histories of individual cash registers and employees, and close deals from anywhere through cloud-based technology. Your physical stores will benefit from the same powerful analytics as your digital channels.
