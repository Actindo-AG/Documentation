# Key features

Successfully digitize your point of sale:
- Complete checkout system   
    The *Venduo POS* module of Actindo offers a complete checkout system with all necessary functions, such as flexible payment methods, returns management or voucher handling. It also enables a digital connection to all your physical stores.  

- Follow stocks centrally and in real time   
    By connecting the *Venduo POS* system to the *Actindo Core1 Platform*, stock changes are always displayed in real-time and you have an overview of all stocks in one central location.

- Connect all stores and cash registers   
    You have the option to link all your stores and cash registers and manage them centrally via the platform. This allows you to see your stock in real time and to track every sale. You can easily connect pop-up stores. The assortment for each store can then be controlled from our *PIM* module. You can assign a complete user history, such as log-in and log-out data, sales data, and stocks to the individual POS systems as well as to users.

- Central data management   
    With automatic data storage and retention, the *Venduo POS* module generates your sales, stuff, and customer data and makes it available centrally on the platform. This way, you can analyze product data and customer purchasing behavior holistically and evaluate them more efficiently.  

- Direct link to *Accounting* and *Order Management*    
    All sales data including products, turnover, and means of payment from your cash registers are transmitted directly and in real-time to accounting and billing in the *Actindo Core1 Platform*. Orders and returns from stores are thus displayed together with your online sales channels.  

- Independence through cloud POS    
    The *Venduo POS* system is cloud-based and therefore available from anywhere on mobile devices. Physical cash drawers and payment terminals <!---Payment terminals kÃ¶nnen doch noch nicht angeschlossen werden, nicht?--> can also be controlled from the cloud POS. 

- TSS provider connection
