# Manage the POS warehouse

Manage the warehouse settings to assign one or more specific warehouses to the POS from which the stock is taken from and posted. The warehouse specifies where exactly the stock is taken from when a product is sold.

## Check the stock allocation

Check if the stock allocation is correctly configured so that the store stock is correctly assigned to the warehouse. The stock source specifies how the stock available in the POS system is calculated. In most cases, the stock source and the warehouse are identical, but they can also differ.   

#### Prerequisites

- A POS store is created, see [Create a store via wizard](./06_CreateStore.md#create-a-store-in-pos-using-the-wizard) or [Create a store manually](./06a_CreateStoreManually.md#create-a-pos-store-manually).
- The stock allocation is configured, see [Configure the stock allocation](./06a_CreateStoreManually.md#configure-the-stock-allocation).

#### Procedure

*Warehouse > Settings > Tab WAREHOUSE > Tab Stock allocation*

![Stock allocation](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteWarehousing/Settings/Warehouse/StockAllocation/StockAllocation.png "[Stock allocation]")

1.  Search for the target channel of the appropriate POS store in the *Target channel* column and check the settings in the corresponding row.

2. If necessary, edit the settings as described in the following:

    + Select the **Calculation, stock** option in the drop-down list in the *Stock calculation* column.   
        The fields in the warehouse columns are unlocked.

    + Double-click the option in a warehouse column to display the drop-down list.
    
    + Select the **Yes** option in the drop-down list to include the corresponding warehouse in the stock calculation or select the **No** option to exclude it.

    > [Info] Select for each warehouse whether it should be included or not.

3. Click the [SAVE] button in the bottom right corner.   
    The stock allocation is saved. The stock is calculated from all selected warehouses.



## Check the stock withdrawal matrix
