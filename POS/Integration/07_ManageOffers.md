# Manage offers for POS

To offer products in Venduo POS, it is recommended to create the products in advance and create the corresponding offers afterwards in order to be able to distribute them properly in the system.


## Create products for POS

To create an offer for POS, it is recommended to create products in the *PIM* module for which you can make an offer.

#### Prerequisites

No prerequisites to fulfill.

#### Procedure

Create the product in the *PIM* module. For detailed information, see [Create a product](../../PIM/Operation/01_ManageProducts.md#create-a-product) in the *PIM* documentation.



## Create a product type

To improve the product classification, you can create a product type and use it in POS. To do this, you create an attribute set in the *PIM* module.  
For detailed information on how to create an attribute set, see [Create an attribute set](../../PIM/Integration/02_ManageAttributeSets.md#create-an-attribute-set) in the *PIM* documentation.



## Map a new product type in POS

When a new product type is created, it must be mapped before offers with this product type can be created for the POS.

#### Prerequisites

At least one new product type has been created, see [Create an attribute set](../../PIM/Integration/02_ManageAttributeSets.md#create-an-attribute-set) in the *PIM* documentation.

#### Procedure

*Venduo POS > Management > Tab MAPPING FROM PIM*

![Mapping from PIM](../../Assets/Screenshots/POS/Management/MappingFromPIM/MappingFromPIM01.png "[Mapping from PIM]")

1. Click the ![Refresh](../../Assets/Icons/Refresh01.png "[Refresh]") (Refresh) button in the upper right corner.   
    All not mapped PIM product types are displayed in the list.

    ![Mapping from PIM](../../Assets/Screenshots/POS/Management/MappingFromPIM/MappingFromPIM02.png "[Mapping from PIM]")

2. Select the checkboxes of the product types you want to map.   
    A toolbar is displayed at the bottom.

3. Click the [CREATE MAPPINGS] button in the toolbar.    
    The selected mappings are removed from the list when the mappings are created.



## Create an offer for POS

Create an offer in the *Omni-Channel* module or a product in the *PIM* module, so you can offer and select the products/offers in the *Venduo POS* store.

If you have the *PIM* module in use, it is recommended to create/edit the products in the *PIM* module. Changes to the *PIM* product are automatically transferred (via ETL) to the offers available in the *Omni-Channel* module.  
Especially if you want to exchange your product data available in the *PIM* module with your stores, you must additionally create the ETL mappings and processes for the data transfer between the PIM product data and the Omni-Channel offer data.



### Create an offer from a PIM product in Omni-Channel

You can create an offer from a PIM product in the *Omni-Channel* module if the corresponding offer exists in the *PIM* module.

> [Info] If the product you want to create an offer for exists in the *PIM* module, it is recommended to create the offer from the PIM product instead of creating a manual offer.

#### Prerequisites

At least one product has been created, see [Create products for POS](#create-products-for-pos).

#### Procedure

For detailed information, see [Create an offer from a PIM product](../../Channels/Operation/01_ManageOffers.md#create-an-offer-from-a-pim-product) in the *Omni-Channel* documentation.



### Create a manual offer in Omni-Channel

You can create a manual offer in the *Omni-Channel* module for all products regardless of whether they exist in the *PIM* module or not.

#### Prerequisites

At least one product has been created, see [Create products for POS](#create-products-for-pos).

#### Procedure

Create an offer manually. For detailed information, see [Create a manual offer](../../Channels/Operation/01_ManageOffers.md#create-a-manual-offer) in the *Omni-Channel* documentation.



### Create a single channel offer in PIM

You can create an offer for a single sales channel for the selected product in the *PIM* module.
<!---Warum wÃ¼rde ich das tun wollen? Use case?-->


#### Prerequisites

At least one product has been created, see [Create products for POS](#create-products-for-pos).

#### Procedure

Create a single channel offer in the *PIM* module. For detailed information, see [Create a single connection offer in PIM](../../PIM/Operation/01_ManageProducts.md#create-a-single-connection-offer-in-pim) in the *PIM* documentation.




### Create a multiple channels offer in PIM

You can create an offer for multiple channels to the selected product in the *PIM* module.

#### Prerequisites

At least one product has been created, see [Create products for POS](#create-products-for-pos).

#### Procedure

Create an offer for multiple sales channels to the selected product in the *PIM* module. For detailed information, see [Create a multi-connection offer in PIM](../../PIM/Operation/01_ManageProducts.md#create-a-multi-connection-offer-in-pim) in the *PIM* documentation.


## Activate a POS offer

An offer has to be active so that it is displayed in the selected sales channel and can be sold there.

#### Prerequisites

At least one offer has been created, see [Create an offer for POS](#create-an-offer-for-pos).
