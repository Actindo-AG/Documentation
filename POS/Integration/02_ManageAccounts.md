# Manage the accounts for POS

To connect the POS system with accounting, you must create the following accounts for each store:

- An account for representing the pay desk
- An account for cashless payments, for instance credit or deposit card payments
- A transit account used as contra account for cash deposits or withdrawals not linked to any order or return

The accounts are all created in the same way. 


## Check the account availability

You may check the availability of a certain account number before creating it, since account numbers can only be assigned once.    
Each account number is assigned to a specific number range, which indicates the account class.    

For detailed information, see [Check the account availability](../../RetailSuiteAccounting/Integration/03_ManageAccounts.md#check-the-account-availability) in the *Accounting* documentation.



## Create an account

To connect the POS system with accounting, create accounts for your POS store.

For detailed information, see [Create an account](../../RetailSuiteAccounting/Integration/03_ManageAccounts.md#create-an-account) in the *Accounting* documentation.

> [Info] Repeat this procedure for each account you want to create.
