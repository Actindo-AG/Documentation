# General information

The *Fiege* driver seamlessly connects the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and the Fiege fulfillment system. Actindo sends automatically a dispatch note containing all relevant order and product data to Fiege when a delivery note has been issued by the *Order management* module. In turn, all shipment data provided by Fiege can be checked and monitored centrally in the *Fulfillment* module. 

This documentation refers to *Fiege Integration* plugin version 1.0.0. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Fiege Integration* plugin is installed in a different version.
