## How it works

**Product data**    
As soon as a delivery note is created, a dispatch note with the relevant product data is generated in Actindo and exported to Fiege. The creation of dispatch notes and the triggering of the export are workflow-driven.

**Delivery and packaging data**  
Preferred user-defined packaging types can be automatically selected in Actindo and transferred to Fiege.  

**Tracking data**   
When the shipment is arranged, Fiege sends shipment status and tracking data back to Actindo.

**Return data**   
If required, all relevant return-related data are updated by Fiege and transferred to Actindo for further processing. 

**Stock data**  
Stock data, managed across several warehouses, are updated by Fiege and transferred to Actindo.
