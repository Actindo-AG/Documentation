# Move a product

Move a product to either archive it, move it to the recycle bin, delete it permanently or restore it.

## Archive a product

You can archive products that you are not currently using, but that you still want to access and may want to use again at a later time. Archived products cannot be permanently deleted but must first be moved to the recycle bin.

#### Prerequisites

At least one product has been created, see [Create a product](./01_ManageProducts.md#create-a-product).

#### Procedure

*PIM > Products > Tab LIST*    
*PIM > Products > Tab RECYCLE BIN*

![List and recycle bin](../../Assets/Screenshots/PIM/Products/ListRecycleBin.png "[List and recycle bin]")

> [Info] You can archive products from the product list or from the recycle bin. The procedure to archive them is identical. To archive a product from the recycle bin, start in the *RECYCLE BIN* tab instead of in the *LIST* tab and follow the steps described below.

1. Select the checkboxes of the products you want to archive.   
  The editing toolbar is displayed above the product list.

2. Click the [ARCHIVE PRODUCTS] button in the editing toolbar.   
  The button changes to [ARCHIVING...]. The *Product moved to archive* pop-up window is displayed, indicating the number of archived products.
