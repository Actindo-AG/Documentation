# Manage a product

A product defines everything that can be offered and purchased on a market. All products are assigned to an attribute set and can be specified by the attributes within this set. You can create master products and product variants, edit products, archive, delete or restore products and copy products. To offer a product on a marketplace you have to create an offer to the product, see [Create an offer](to_be_completed).

## Create a product

Create a product to offer it on a marketplace. You can create a master product or create product variants to an existing master product, see [Create a variant](#create-a-variant-to-a-product).

### Prerequisites

An attribute set is created, see [Create an attribute set](ManageAttributeSet.md#Create-an-attribute-set).

2. Select a attribute set in the drop-down list *Select attribute set*. All active attribute sets are displayed in the drop-down list.

  > [Info] The SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is an identification number for the product. Therefore, it should be uniquely assigned to a single product.

  The *Create Product* view is displayed. The tab *Attributes* is preselected.

  > [Info] All fields marked with the note *(required)* are used for the completeness calculation of product attributes. You can activate the toggle ![Toggle](/Assets/Icons/Toggle.png "[Toggle]") *show empty required attributes only* to display only the incomplete required attribute fields for the selected product.

6. Click the button [SAVE] in the upper right corner.
