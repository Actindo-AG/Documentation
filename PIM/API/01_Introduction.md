# Introduction

There are two ways to interact with the *Actindo Core1 Platform* - via user interface (user interactive requests) and via API (API requests). You can perform most of actions using both access methods. 

Both methods require authentication. If accessing the Core1 via user interface using a browser, you need to log into the system with your credentials. When the system receives valid credentials, it authenticates the user. The user interactive session is then started. If accessing the Core via API, you use a software, usually a third-party tool, to handle all communication with the system.

*Actindo Core1 Platform* uses the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification (OAS).

## Authentication

| **Security Scheme Type** | **AuthorizationCode OAuth Flow** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| OAuth2 | **Authorization URL:** /Actindo.CoreModules.Auth.OAuth2.authorize |
|    | **Token URL:** /Actindo.CoreModules.Auth.OAuth2Token.getAccessToken |


 
Authorization vs Token

The *Actindo Core1 Platform* supports two workflows of the OAuth2 protocol to retrieve an access token to make authenticated requests.

This document covers using the OAuth2 protocol to allow other services to access Core1 account on users behalf.

If you want your Core1 Account to be an OAuth2 authentication service provider to sign into other Actindo APIs, ...

## Methods 

The *POST* method is always used for all Actindo API endpoints. All other methods are not relevant for communication with the Core1 platform.


## Response codes

The response codes correspond the standard HTTP status codes. For detailed information, see [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes]").



## Required attributes  

Attributes can be required or optional. Required attributes must always be provided when sending a request.

## Format
