# Configure the language settings

If you want to maintain PIM-products in multiple languages, you have to activate the respective languages in the PIM module. By default, the languages *English (United States)* and *German (Germany)* are predefined and activated. Note that the completeness of products is recalculated when a language is activated or deactivated.

## Prerequisites

At least one language has to be created in the DataHub module, see [Create a language](/DataHub/Integration/CreateLanguage.md).

## Procedure
*PIM > Settings > Tab LANGUAGES*

![Languages](/Assets/Screenshots/PIM/Settings/Languages/Languages.png "[Languages]")

1. Activate the toggle ![Toggle](/Assets/Icons/Toggle.png "[Toggle]") *Active* in the row of the language you want to switch active in the *PIM* module.

  > [Info] At least one language has to be activated.

2. Press **F5** to initialize the Core1 Platform.
