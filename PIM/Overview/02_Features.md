## Always agile - always prepared for growth

More Flexibility for Your Requirements   
Every company has its own unique product data management requirements. The Actindo PIM module enables you to efficiently manage products across all channels. Not only can you maintain product data, but you can also design data management to meet your individual needs. For example, create your own product types with specific attributes, maintain products in multiple languages and decide which data exists on which channels. Flexibility is a synonym for Actindo PIM.

## Integrative - simple - fast to use
A Perfect Fit for Existing IT   
Is your IT infrastructure built on legacy systems such as SAP or AS/400? With Actindo, you don't have to replace your functioning system landscape. The PIM can be easily connected to your existing systems and online shop technology which enables an optimal data exchange. As a result, you can digitize and centralize your trade processes quickly and with little effort.

## Actindo data accelerator hub

Touchpoint Excellence Thanks to DataHub and ETL   
The Actindo PIM unfolds its full power, especially in combination with the Actindo DataHub. Thanks to ETL, the DataHub ensures that even the most complex and varying data can be easily mapped, transformed and transferred to other modules and external systems. This way, you will maintain your product data centrally in the Actindo PIM and play it out individually and automatically for each sales channel. In practice, this means less adjustment effort: manually creating and moving product data in different systems or Excel files is a thing of the past.
