# General information

All modules within the Actindo Core1 platform are interconnected via ETL as well as external services. This gives companies the flexibility to customize their individual data fields and sources for every single process. The Actindo DataHub is therefore the system’s central data hub. Its flexible data model enables complex and varying data to be mapped, transformed and transferred to other modules as well as external systems – all of this fully automated via ETL.

The Actindo DataHub module offers the following benefits:
- Quickly connect external systems and automate data exchange  
- Central data storage to break up data silos  
- Easy integration and harmonization of sales channels and touchpoints  
- Optimization of processes via automatic data transfers in real time
