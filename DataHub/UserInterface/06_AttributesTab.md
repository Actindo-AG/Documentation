![Attributes](../../Assets/Screenshots/PIM/Products/List/Attributes/AttributesEdit.png "[Attributes]")

This tab is not part of the *DataHub* module, but it is used in many other *Core1 Platform* modules that refer to information coming from the *DataHub* module.

**Attributes**  

The list displays all attributes that define the selected entity. An entity is a data object that can be identified uniquely and is defined by means of its attributes. An entity can be a *PIM* product or an *Omni-Channel* offer, but also a business document, such as a dispatch note. 

Depending on the entity, you can edit different attribute values. For example, in the case of the entity *PIM* single product, displayed in the screenshot, you can edit the product name, the long text, EAN code, assign images for a product, etc. The attribute values you can edit vary from one entity to another. The fields of the attribute values that cannot be edited are locked. To edit an attribute or create a new one, you have to go to the *DataHub* module. For detailed information, see [Manage the attributes](../Integration/01_ManageAttributes.md).     

In the left margin column, all available attribute groups of the entity are displayed. Click an attribute group to display the attributes that are assigned to this group on the right side of the *Attributes* tab. If the entity contains attributes that are not assigned, the *Unassigned group* attribute group is automatically displayed in the left margin column.
