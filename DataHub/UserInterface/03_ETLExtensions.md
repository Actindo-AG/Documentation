# ETL extensions list

The ETL (Extract Transform Load) is used to extract data from a certain source, transform it in a specific way and load it into a defined destination. In the *DataHub* module, the attribute sets are mapped via ETL. The attributes of the source attribute set are mapped to the attributes of the destination attribute set.   
The ETL extensions are used to define how the data is transformed from the source attribute to the destination attribute. The ETL extensions provided for a mapping differ depending on the destination attribute. The data type of the destination attribute determines the available ETL extensions. The selected extension, in turn, determines the available source attributes by defining the data type of the source attribute. In addition, further settings can be defined for some ETL extensions.    
The list below describes in detail all available ETL extensions and, if available, their specific configurations. The following ETL extensions are described in detail:

![Price to tax class](../../Assets/Screenshots/DataHub/Settings/ETL/Extensions/PriceToTaxClass.png "[Price to tax class]")

This extension is used to map a PIM price field attribute to a destination attribute. The PIM price field is Actindo specific and contains not only the simple price, but also the base price, scale prices, promotion prices, the tax class including the tax rate and supported currencies. Each of this data is extracted from the price attribute by the corresponding extension. In this case, the tax class is mapped to the destination attribute. The configuration settings are only displayed if a destination attribute with the tree node data type is selected.


### Possible data type mappings

> [Info] The data type of the destination attribute and the selected ETL extension determine the data type of the source attribute.

| Destination attribute data type  | Source attribute data type     |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Tax class                        | Price field                    |
| Tree node                        | Price field                    |

### Configuration

The configuration depends on the selected tax class attribute. A single drop-down list is displayed for each tax class defined in the source attribute.


**Map PIM tax classes to corresponding tree nodes**

- *"Tax class name"*   
  Click the drop-down list and select the applicable tax class to be mapped to the tax class in the destination attribute. All available tax rates from the destination attribute are displayed in the list.

## Pricing to float

![Pricing to float](../../Assets/Screenshots/DataHub/Settings/ETL/Extensions/PricingToFloat.png "[Pricing to float]")

This extension is used to map a PIM price field attribute to a destination attribute. The PIM price field is Actindo specific and contains not only the simple price, but also the base price, scale prices, promotion prices, the tax class including the tax rate and supported currencies. Each of this data is extracted from the price attribute by the corresponding extension. In this case, the simple price is mapped to the destination attribute. A discount to the price can be entered in the *Discount in percent* attribute. Further price settings are defined in the configuration.

  Click the drop-down list and select the unit to be mapped to the corresponding source value. All units corresponding to the selected dimension are displayed in the list. A different dimension can be selected for each source value. This drop-down list is locked until a dimension is selected in the *Dimension* drop-down list.



## Tree node and basic price to PIM price

![Tree node and basic price to PIM price](../../Assets/Screenshots/DataHub/Settings/ETL/Extensions/TreeNodeBasicPriceToPIMPrice.png "[Tree node and basic price to PIM price]")

This extension is used to map a tree node attribute and a price attribute to a PIM price field attribute. This mapping is often used to import offers or product from another system to Actindo. The simple price as well as the tax class are mapped to the PIM price field attribute. The different tax classes are defined in the configuration. The configuration settings are only displayed after a tax class attribute has been selected. As the PIM price field attribute also needs a currency and an indication whether the net or the gross price is specified, the default currency in the PIM system and the gross price value are mapped. To specify all values to be mapped to the PIM price field attribute, use the [PriceBuilder](#pricebuilder) extension.

### Configuration

- *Unit to convert to*   
  Click the drop-down list and select the appropriate unit of the destination attribute to convert the quantity value into the correct unit. All units corresponding to the dimension of the source attribute are displayed in the list.



## Unit value to text

![Unit value to text](../../Assets/Screenshots/DataHub/Settings/ETL/Extensions/UnitValueToText.png "[Unit value to text]")

This extension is used to map a unit attribute to a string attribute. A unit attribute always includes a unit and a quantity. The settings how to display both values in the string attribute are defined in the configuration.

### Possible data type mappings

> [Info] The data type of the destination attribute and the selected ETL extension determine the data type of the source attribute.

| Destination attribute data type  | Source attribute data type          |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| String                           | Unit                                |

### Configuration


- *Mode*     
  Click the drop-down list and select the unit mapping mode. The following options are available:
  - **Keep unit**   
    The source unit is mapped to the destination attribute.
  - **Configured unit**   
    The unit to be mapped to the destination attribute must be selected in the *Configured unit* drop-down list.
  - **Destination unit**   
    The destination unit is kept in the destination attribute.

  [comment]: <> (Destination Unit -> error; Configured Unit -> not working and no drop-down list displayed; ergibt auch irgendwie beides keinen sinn, oder?)


- *Suffix Mode*   
  Click the drop-down list and select the suffix display mode for the unit. The following options are available:
  - **Suffix symbol**   
    The unit is displayed by its symbol or abbreviation, for instance *cm*.
