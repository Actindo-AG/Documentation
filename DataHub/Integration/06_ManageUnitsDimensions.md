# Manage the units and dimensions

The units and dimensions are used to assign units to attributes with different data types. While editing attributes, you can select predefined units and dimensions within drop-down lists.   
The units are preset by the system and grouped by dimensions.  For example, the length dimension contains units of length such as meters, kilometers or miles. You can define the base unit of a dimension and activate or deactivate single units within a dimension or a whole dimension.

## Deactivate a unit

Deactivate a unit if you do not want to use it. For example, if a unit is not used in the countries you ship to, or you want to shorten the unit's drop-down list. You can always activate a unit again, if you realize that you still need them after all.
