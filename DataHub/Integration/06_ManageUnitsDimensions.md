# Manage the units and dimensions

The units and dimensions are used for the values of attributes with different data types. The predefined units and dimensions can be selected within drop-down lists. The dimensions and corresponding units are preset by the system. You can activate or deactivate the single units within a dimension or a whole dimension.
