# General information

The requirements for modern accounting software go far beyond document posting. The *Accounting* module includes all functions of accounts receivable and accounts payable and can meet even the most complex requirements.

The *Actindo Core1 Platform* is the only digital operations platform worldwide with a complete accounting module integrated. This means that all postings for all orders of the connected channels and accounts are automatically generated and optionally transferred live to a group accounting system. As a result, your data integration is extremely simplified and easy to manage.
