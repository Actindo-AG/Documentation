# General information

The requirements for modern accounting software go far beyond document posting. The Actindo *Accounting* module includes all functions of accounts receivable and accounts payable and can meet even the most complex of requirements.

The Actindo Core1 platform is the only middleware worldwide with a complete accounting module integrated. This means that all bookings for all orders of the connected channels and accounts are automatically generated and optionally transferred live to a group accounting system. As a result, your data integration is extremely simplified and easy to manage.

This documentation refers to *Accounting* module version 4.1.1. There may be differences in the UI, features and operation if your *Accounting* module is installed in a different version.
