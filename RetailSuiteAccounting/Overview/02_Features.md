## Modern accounting

**Digital workflows in accounting**  
Folders full of paper invoices are a thing of the past. However, just digitizing transmission and processing of invoices is not enough. Efficient digitization of accounting involves automating everyday workflows, such as payment reconciliation, document verification and reminders. Automated processes will not only save you time, but also avoid errors that are common when working manually.

## Data export made easy

**Flexibility through interfaces**  
Before switching to a Digital Operations Platform, companies usually already use other IT systems and isolated applications, including accounting tools. To avoid having to completely replace these, you can connect service providers such as DATEV or SAP to the *Actindo Core1 Platform* and easily export your data. GDPdU-certified exports for tax officials are also possible with the help of our *Accounting* module.

## Actindo digital payments hub

**Automated payment processes with the payment processing and accounting module**  
The automatic processing and posting of payments are important success and efficiency factors for companies,  especially when orders are received from several sales channels and different payment methods are offered via external service providers. By linking the *Accounting* and *Payment processing* modules, the *Actindo Core1 Platform* enables a holistic automated process flow from the receipt of payments, through processing, to the final allocation of incoming payments. Our *Payment processing* module acts as a link between payment providers and Actindo accounting.
