# Review an account

The *Book* menu entry in the *Accounting* module contains specific functions to display different views of the data available in the system. All bookings recorded in the *Accounting* module can be filtered per account and period and visually displayed for better clarity or for checking purposes.


## Access the balance view of an account

 The *BALANCES* tab offers a T-account view of the current credit and debit situation, and the resulting balance of a selected account.

 The balance value represents the difference between credits and debits in the account. If the debit and credit totals are equal, the balance is settled. If a difference between them exists, there is an outstanding balance to be settled, for example, a payment must be made to bring the account balance to zero.

 > [Info] When clicking the *BALANCES* tab for the first time, blank tabs are displayed. An account must be selected to display the corresponding details. If a booking is selected in the *BOOKINGS* tab, the account and contra account details corresponding to the selected booking will be displayed in the *BALANCES* tab.

### Prerequisites

- A valid fiscal year is created, see [Create fiscal year](04_ManageFiscalYear.md#create-a-fiscal-year).
