# Split a booking

In some occasions, it may be necessary to split a booking to keep track of different items separately, for example if an invoice includes products with different tax rates or if total costs must be divided into two or more cost centres. Split bookings can affect both debit and credit accounts, that is, incoming and outgoing invoices.

The [SPLIT] button in the *BOOKINGS* tab allows to split bookings during the manual booking process. For detailed information about how to create a manual booking, see [Create a manual booking](05_CreateManualBooking).

Once the splitting has been performed, the different split (partial) bookings are assigned to the corresponding accounts. The split bookings are then displayed in the bookings list underneath the main booking.

> [Info] Splitting a booking must be performed during the manual booking process. When splitting an invoice after the booking has been automatically registered following a business transaction or after it has been manually created, the system creates a copy of the existing main booking with the newly assigned contra accounts.

3. Enter the date for the manual booking in the *Date* field. Date format must be TTMMJJ or TT.MM.JJ.

4. Enter a personal account number in the *Account* field, that is, a debtor (customer) or a creditor (provider) account number.

  > [Info] Note that the fields *Date* and *Account* must be filled out to be able to split a booking. The *Contra Account* field can be specified when splitting the booking.

5. Enter any other relevant fixed booking information in the corresponding fields.

  > [Info] Even though it is not compulsory, it is highly recommended to fill in the *Receipt 1* field, as the system identifies and groups together any subsequent bookings taking this field as reference.
