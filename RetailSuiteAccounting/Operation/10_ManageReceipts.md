# Manage receipts

Receipts are used to document all transactions and, therefore, play an indispensable role for a correct accounting. Every posting needs to have a receipt as a basis. There are many different types of receipts, such as invoice, credit note, cash voucher or rebooking document.

The *Accounting* module offers three possible ways to manage and assign receipts to postings:

- Click the [ASSIGN RECEIPT] button in the *POSTINGS* tab to assign a receipt to an existing posting in the postings list, see [Retrieve a receipt](#retrieve-a-receipt).
- Access the *POST RECEIPTS* tab to assign a receipt uploaded in the *Documents* module and create the corresponding posting manually, see [Post a receipt](#post-a-receipt).
- Click the *Supplier receipts* menu entry in the *EDIT* context menu to specifically assign a supplier receipt, see [Post a supplier receipt](#post-a-supplier-receipt).

> [Info] *Supplier receipts* is a special feature that interacts with the *Purchasing* and *Payment processing* modules, and therefore the appropriate settings must be configured first.



## Retrieve a receipt

You can retrieve and assign a receipt that has not yet been registered to an existing posting. Any unregistered receipts uploaded in the system are displayed in the *POST RECEIPTS* tab.  

After being uploaded, the receipts are stored in the *New documents* folder in the *Documents* module. Once they are booked, they are moved automatically into the *Registered documents* folder and then placed in the appropriate sub-folder according to the following structure:

- 10000-69999 personal account numbers in case of a debtors'/customers' document
- 70000-99999 personal account numbers in case of a creditors'/suppliers' document

#### Prerequisites

- A fiscal year has been selected, see [Select fiscal year](./01_SelectFiscalYear.md).

## Post a supplier receipt

In addition to the posting process and assignment of general receipts, there is an enhanced function to specifically post supplier receipts.

Suppliers' invoices can be uploaded in the *New supplier receipts* folder in the *Documents* module, which will be recognized by the system and displayed in the *Acquire* tab in the *Supplier receipts* window. Once the supplier receipts are posted, they are moved automatically into the *Acquired documents* folder.

Moreover, this function interacts with the *Purchasing* and *Payment processing* modules, and allows to check supplier receipts before posting them in the system. For example, the person who placed the order can be responsible for approving the supplier receipt and releasing the payment.
