# Delete bookings

You can delete postings that are no longer needed, for example, if a posting is faulty.
It is possible to delete a single posting or to delete multiple postings at once. Bear in mind, however, that the postings to be deleted must be unprocessed, as postings that have already been processed cannot be deleted. For detailed information, see [Process postings](./07_ProcessBookings.md).
