# Manage the BWA reports

[comment]: <> (BWA reports or Accounting Reports? See Accounting Reports view -> ZUORDNUNG BWA tab)

The business evaluation (BWA) is a reporting system based on company financial data and provides information about the company's current cost and revenue situation and, consequently, its  profitability. BWA reports serve as a basis for managerial future decisions, and they are widely used by capital investors and credit institutions for company assessment. BWA provides important information for the controlling of the company.

You can create new BWA reports, copy and edit one of the predefined system reports or delete any report. All available reports can be fully customized.

> [Info] Be aware that any deletion is permanent and cannot be undone, and that any changes made will overwrite the preset values.

When customizing existing reports, bear in mind that the reports use the standard accounts set up in the *Accounting* module configuration process. For detailed information, see [Chart of accounts](./01_RunAccountingWizard.md#chart-of-accounts). If the accounts have been customized manually, they must be set up again individually for the BWA reports. Otherwise, they will not be recognized by the BWA reports.

8. If the **Calculation** option has been previously selected, enter the applicable formula in the *Formula* field to calculate the value to be output in the report line. The basic calculating operations (+, -, *, /) are permitted.

    Below, the most usual formulas and functions are explained.

    > [Info] The arguments enclosed in square brackets are optional. The brackets must not be included in the formula when calling the function, since they could cause an error. DEBIT balances are always displayed as negative ("-") numbers and CREDIT balances as positive ("+") numbers, irrespectively of the account type.

    | Formula         | Function      | 
    |-----------------|---------------|
    | _l(from[, to])  | Lines          | 
    |                 | Lines from - to are added up. If only "from" is specified, only the value of the specified line will be output.|
    |_k(from[, to])   | Accounts        |
    |                 | Accounts from - to are added up. If only "from" is specified, only the value of the specified account will be output.|
    |_kh(from[, to])  | Accounts CREDIT |
    |                 | Accounts from - to are added up if the account balance of the respective accounts is in CREDIT.|
    |_ks(from[, to])  | Accounts DEBIT |
    |                 | Accounts from - to are added up if the account balance of the respective accounts is in DEBIT.|
    |_uh(from[, to])  | Turnover CREDIT |
    |                 | This function outputs only the CREDIT part of the account.|
    |_us(from[, to])  | Turnover DEBIT | 
    |                 | This function outputs only the DEBIT part of the account.|
    |_bh(from, to[, from, to][, from, to]...)| Block CREDIT | 
    |                 | Several from - to combinations can be specified here. If this block of account numbers is in CREDIT, the function provides a balance, otherwise "0" is displayed.|
    |_bs(from, to[, from, to][, from, to]...)| Block DEBIT | 
    |                 | Several from - to combinations can be specified here. If this block of account numbers is in DEBIT, the function provides a balance, otherwise "0" is displayed.|

9. If desired, activate the first toggle button in the *Percent / Columns* field and enter the applicable formula in the *Formula* field. This function is used to calculate the percentage of the value expressed in the current line in relation to the overall turnover and display it in an additional column in the BWA report.

10. Click the [SAVE] button.  
    The new report line has been added to the BWA report.

11. Repeat this procedure to add as many lines as necessary to create your BWA report. 

    > [Info] Creating a BWA report is extremely complex. All relevant accounts must be specified and no duplicates must be included, otherwise the calculations will be distorted.   
    To simplify the process, it is recommended to use one of the predefined BWA reports as a basis and edit it to adjust it to your needs, see [Copy a predefine BWA report](#copy-a-predefined-bwa-report).
