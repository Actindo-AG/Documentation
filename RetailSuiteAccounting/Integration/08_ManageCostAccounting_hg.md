# Manage the cost accounting

Cost accounting is a method to identify, measure and record all costs associated with a company's production process. It serves as an internal controlling tool to assess the different business costs and determine profitability by department, producer, client, product, or other criteria.   

A cost center is a department or a function within a company to which costs may be allocated, such as HR, Accounting or IT. It can also be defined at a smaller level according to management needs, for instance involving a particular job position or machine.  

A cost object is a product or service in relation to which costs are ascertained. The cost object is determined by the nature of business. It can be the final item produced or a part of it, but can also be expressed differently, for instance in batches of items.  

You can create, edit and delete both cost centers and cost objects.
