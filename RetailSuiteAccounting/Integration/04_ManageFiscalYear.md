# Manage the fiscal year

The fiscal year is set up during the configuration process via the accounting wizard, see [Fiscal years](01_RunAccountingWizard.md#fiscal-years). After the initial fiscal year is set up during configuration, any subsequent fiscal years must be manually created. It is essential to create a new fiscal year in the system at the beginning of the new fiscal year.

> [Info] If the system cannot find a fiscal year to book any newly issued invoices, they will remain unrecognized and will have to be booked again manually via the *Invoicing* module, once the new fiscal year has been created.  

## Create a fiscal year

You can create a fiscal year that is not yet available in the system.

### Prerequisites

- The accounting is configured via the configuration wizard, see [Run the Accounting Wizard](01_RunAccountingWizard.md).

### Procedure

*Accounting > Select the fiscal year > Settings > Tab FISCAL YEARS*

![Create a fiscal year](/Assets/Screenshots/Accounting/Settings/FiscalYear/Create_FiscalYear.png "[Create a fiscal year")

1. Enter a description for the fiscal year in the field *Description*. The system shows the current year by default.  

 > [Info] Note that it is possible to enter digits, letters or combinations of characters. The number of characters is limited to 10.

2.  Enter the starting and finishing date of your fiscal year in the fields *From - To*. The fiscal year shown by default is the current calendar year.

  > [Info] Note that the fiscal year must consist of 12 months. However, it does not have to be a calendar year, for example from 1st April to 31st March.

  > [Info] Fiscal years cannot overlap in time, for example, fiscal years 2022 and 2022-2023 cannot coexist. If two fiscal years overlap, an error message will be displayed. However, a fiscal year for planning purposes can overlap in time with actual fiscal years.

3. Click the drop-down list *Currency* and select the base currency. The drop-down list displays all currencies configured in the system. However, the accounting module works with the base currency only.

4. Click the drop-down list *Cash accounting* and select the appropriate option (**No/Yes**).

  > [Info] The cash accounting refers to a method where receipts are recorded during the period they are received, and expenses are recorded in the period in which they are actually paid. This contrasts accrual accounting, where revenue is recognized when earned rather than when collected, and expenses are recognized when incurred rather than when paid.

  > [Warning] This option has fundamental implications for the system automatic recording of taxes. In case of doubt, please check with your tax advisor.

5. Click the drop-down list *Planning FY* and select the appropriate option (**No/Fiscal year for planning purposes only**).   

  > [Info] Note that a fiscal year can be set up for planning purposes only. However, the fiscal year for planning purposes will not be recognized as an actual fiscal year by the system, and therefore the automatic functions in the interaction with other modules will not apply.

6. Click [SAVE & NEW].  
The new fiscal year is created.    
A small pop-up window confirms that the new fiscal year has been saved. The newly created fiscal year is also displayed in the list.
