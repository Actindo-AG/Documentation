The entry fields allow to create, edit or delete fiscal years. For detailed information about creating, editing or deleting fiscal years, see [Manage the fiscal year](../Integration/04_ManageFiscalYear.md).

- *From - to*  
Enter or modify the fiscal year start and end date.

  > [Info] The fiscal year must consist of 12 months. However, it does not have to be a calendar year, for example from 1st April to 31st March.

  > [Info] Fiscal years cannot overlap in time, for example, fiscal years 2022 and 2022-2023 cannot coexist. If two fiscal years overlap, an error message will be displayed. However, a fiscal year for planning purposes can overlap in time with actual fiscal years.

- *Currency*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate currency.

  > [Info] The drop-down list displays all currencies configured in the system. However, the *Accounting* module works with the base currency only.

- *Cash accounting*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate option (**No/Yes**).

  > [Info] The cash accounting refers to a method where receipts are recorded during the period they are received, and expenses are recorded in the period in which they are actually paid. This contrasts with accrual accounting, where revenue is recognized when earned rather than when collected, and expenses are recognized when incurred rather than when paid.

  > [Warning] This option has fundamental implications for the system automatic recording of taxes. In case of doubt, please check with your tax advisor.

- *Planning FY*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate option (**No/Fiscal year for planning purposes only**).

  > [Info] Note that a fiscal year can be set up for planning purposes only. However, the fiscal year for planning purposes will not be recognized as an actual fiscal year by the system, and therefore the automatic functions in the interaction with other modules will not apply.
