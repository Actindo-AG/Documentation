The input fields allow to create, edit or delete fiscal years. For detailed information about creating, editing or deleting fiscal years, see [Manage the fiscal year](../Integration/04_ManageFiscalYear.md).

- *Description*  
Enter or modify the fiscal year. Letters, numbers or a combination of characters can be used. The number of characters is limited to 10.

- *From - to*  
Enter or modify the fiscal year start and end date. The fiscal year must consist of 12 months. However, it does not have to be a calendar year, but can be, for example from April 1 to March 31.

  > [Info] Fiscal years cannot overlap in time, for example, fiscal years 2022 and 2022-2023 cannot coexist. If two fiscal years overlap, an error message will be displayed. A fiscal year for planning purposes, on the other hand, can overlap in time with actual fiscal years.

- *Currency*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate currency. The drop-down list displays all currencies configured in the system. However, the accounting module works with the base currency only.

 > [Info] The base currency is the currency used by a company for accounting purposes, usually the currency of the country where the business is primarily based, even if it operates in other countries and currencies.

- *Cash accounting*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate option. The following options are available:

  - **Yes**  
  Select this option for the cash accounting method, where receipts are recorded during the period they are received, and expenses are recorded in the period in which they are actually paid.
  - **No**  
  Select this option for the accrual accounting method, where revenue is recognized when earned rather than when collected, and expenses are recognized when incurred rather than when paid.

  > [Info] This option has fundamental implications for the system automatic recording of taxes. In case of doubt, please check with your tax advisor.

- *Planning FY*  
Click the drop-down list to select the appropriate option (**No/Fiscal year for planning purposes only**).

  > [Info] Note that a fiscal year can be set up for planning purposes only. However, the fiscal year for planning purposes will not be recognized as an actual fiscal year by the system, and therefore the automatic functions in the interaction with other modules will not apply.
