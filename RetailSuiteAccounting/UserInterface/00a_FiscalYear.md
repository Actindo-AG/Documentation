![Select fiscal year](../../Assets/Screenshots/RetailSuiteAccounting/SelectFiscalYear.png "[Select fiscal year]")

When opening the *Accounting* module for the first time after logging in or after reloading the system, the fiscal year window is displayed. Select the appropriate values to display the corresponding period. For detailed information, see [Select fiscal year](../Operation/01_SelectFiscalYear.md).

The following fields are displayed:

- *Fiscal Year*  
  Click the drop-down list to select the fiscal year.

- *Period (DD.MM.YYYY) to (DD.MM.YYYY)*  
  The period fields are filled in automatically and correspond to the selected fiscal year. These fields are read-only.

- *Month*  
  Click the drop-down list to select the month. The following options are available:  

    - **0 - Balances carried forward**
    - **1 - 12 - (calendar month)**
    - **13 - 15 - Subsequent postings**
    - **16 - 25 - Closing postings**
    - **99 - General month**


- *Journal*  
  Enter the journal number. There are two main types of journals preconfigured in the system:

  - General journals (1-12)  
  They match with the fiscal year months, irrespectively of whether or not the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. That means, the first fiscal year month corresponds to journal 1, the second to journal 2 and so on.

  - Special journals (90-99)  
  They are specialized lists of transactions records preconfigured in the system. Further journals can be created up to 99. To do so, simply enter a new journal number in the *Journal* field.

- [LIST]  
Click this button to display all available journals and the number of postings contained in each of them is displayed.
