## Gitub Workflow  

In the following, the setup and configuration of all necessary software as well as the cloning of the GitHub documentation repository and the Git documentation workflow from creating a new branch up to merging the branches is described.

### Software

The following software needs to be installed and configured:
- [Code editor](#code-editor)
- [Git](#Git)
- [GitHub](#GitHub)


#### Code editor

The documentation is written in markdown. To do so, you should use an code editor. If you have already worked with an code editor and you are used to a certain one, you can use this one. If not, there are several free editors you can use, such as Atom (https://atom.io/), Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/), Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc.

Download the application and install it on your local machine.


#### Git

Git is a modern version control system which is perfect to use in teams. It tracks all changes in the documentation.
Depending on the operating system, Git may already been installed. Follow the guide to check if Git is already installed on your system or to install it:  https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

If you are working on Windows machine, it is recommended to install Git Bash as a terminal instead of the windows command prompt. If you use the Windows Installer for Git in the link above, Git Bash is included in the download.


#### GitHub
