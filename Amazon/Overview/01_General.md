# General information

The integration of the Actindo *Omni-Channel* module with Amazon Marketplace enables listing, inventory and pricing from the central PIM master data for all products with ASIN.

Amazon orders can be managed and distributed using the integrated order management, warehouse management and integrated support for other fulfillers including Amazon FBA. Order status, tracking numbers and invoice documents are automatically updated in Amazon. 

To speed up the initial set-up, the sellers's listings can be downloaded and linked to PIM products automatically.
